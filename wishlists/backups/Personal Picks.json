I wouldn't take away from Stability, but I also don't think it needs investment. Nor does range. Even if you try to top it out with Barrel and Mag, you're only getting two more meters of ADS distance. So that leaves Reload and Handling. I think Reload needs more help at base, then you can focus on Handling. You don't want to ignore Handling altogether because when you get Hunter's Trace up, you want to get scoped in fast.",

I would avoid any mags or chambers that boost recoil direction as it really does not need the boost with having near perfect recoil pattern already. I would NOT go with Extended Mag as the reload stat is already a full 3 seconds at base and even with full stacks of enlightened action you're looking at ~2.4 seconds to reload.
