// Albedo Wing PvE first-choice roll
// auxilliary Reserves, Low-Impedence Windings, Appended Mag, Grave Robber, Field Prep, Close To Melee
//notes: Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 91 https://open.spotify.com/episode/50NPk7xF3Tt6X3DVucE9jU?si=44d2b7d44a5a4aec with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of bulkier Minor, and Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Only the second Aggressive Glaive subtype so there's not much of a comparison to make, but Albedo Wing seems to have decent stats. The range is good, so you can focus on the shield duration stat with the haft perk for major damage reduction in PvE. Although the reload speed is also poor, we can bypass that with traits, so Appended Mag ups mag size by one. In the first trait column, Grave Robber procs on glaive melees, or Field prep boosts reserves, and reload speed when crouched, and Close to Melee in the second boosts melee damage by 30% for a projectile hit. The Dawning Surprise origin trait is very useful in PvE - when the behind the scenes counter hits 100, the surprise is spawned on the ground for 10s and grants 10% energy to all abilities, grants 20HP and starts shield/health regeneration. Recommended MW: Shield Duraction, with a damage boosting Minor, Major or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-boss, pve-minor, pve-major, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

// Zephyr PvE first-choice roll
// Jagged Edge, HonedEdge, Tempered Edge, Swordmaster's Guard, Relentless Strikes, Cold Steel
//notes: Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 91 https://open.spotify.com/episode/50NPk7xF3Tt6X3DVucE9jU?si=44d2b7d44a5a4aec with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies and Champions in end-game content, particularly with a Stasis subclass. Zephyr's stats are much like any other adaptive sword, except the DSC raid-drop Bequest. But it has a trick that now other sword can do - the Cold Steel trait perk. For single target damage, the additional damage from Jagged Edge is the best choice, although Honed Edge and Tempered Edge are decent alternatives. Swordmaster's Guard is the usual recommendation for swords, but don't discount other guards that help with guarding stats as you'll be up close and will probably need the damage resistance. As your trait perk combination, both Relentless Strikes and Cold Steel proc off three hits, with the first two Cold Steel hits Stasis slowing and the third hit freezing enemies. That covers Overload and Unstoppable Champions. Throw on Radiant from a solar subclass to cover Barriers too, and you have the sword equivalent of Riptide which will freeze lock Majors with every third hit, and which you can apply Stasis subclass fragments too as well. The Dawning Surprise origin trait is very useful in PvE - when the behind the scenes counter hits 100, the surprise is spawned on the ground for 10s and grants 10% energy to all abilities, grants 20HP and starts shield/health regeneration. Recommended MW: Impact, with a damage boosting Major or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-boss, pve-major, pve-champion, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Zephyr's stats are much like any other adaptive sword, except the DSC raid-drop Bequest. For single target damage it doesn't really do anything that other swords don't already cover, but if you don't have one for boss damage, yet the additional damage from Jagged Edge is the best choice, although Honed Edge and Tempered Edge are decent alternatives. Swordmaster's Guard is the usual recommendation for swords, but don't discount other guards that help with guarding stats as you'll be up close and will probably need the damage resistance. For burst damage, Relentless Strikes returns ammo on every third hit and Whirlwind Blade can quickly boost damage by 30% after 10 hits. The Dawning Surprise origin trait is very useful in PvE - when the behind the scenes counter hits 100, the surprise is spawned on the ground for 10s and grants 10% energy to all abilities, grants 20HP and starts shield/health regeneration.

// Zephyr PvE first-choice roll
// Enduring Blade, Hungry Edge, Tempered Edge, Swordmaster's Guard, Tireless Blade, Relentless Strikes, Unrelenting, Chain Reaction, Surrounded, Collective Action
//notes: Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 91 https://open.spotify.com/episode/50NPk7xF3Tt6X3DVucE9jU?si=44d2b7d44a5a4aec with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content. Zephyr's stats are much like any other adaptive sword, except the DSC raid-drop Bequest. For add clearing, it doesn't really do anything that other swords don't already cover, but if you don't have one yet for add clearing, the a mag boosting blade slot perk keeps you slashing for longer. Swordmaster's Guard is the usual recommendation for swords, but don't discount other guards that help with guarding stats as you'll be up close and will probably need the damage resistance. In the first trait slot, as the support perk, Tireless Blade or Relentless Strikes return ammo, or Unrelenting recovers health. In the second, you could use Chain Reaction for the explosions to help clear adds, or Surrounded or Collective Action for additional damage to help clear bulkier Minor spec and the occasional Major spec enemies. The Dawning Surprise origin trait is very useful in PvE - when the behind the scenes counter hits 100, the surprise is spawned on the ground for 10s and grants 10% energy to all abilities, grants 20HP and starts shield/health regeneration.

// Indebted Kindness PvE first-choice roll
// Volatile Launch, Confined Launch, Linear Compensator, High-Explosive Ordnance, Lead From Gold, Beacon Rounds, Loose Change, Permeability
//notes: Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 90 https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C3Wx7xXVw10WshiLn5sT8?si=ZNEiHi_ZRfW5z3BbkOMrVQ with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways, and @Saint_Kabr. ??? 106909392 2420895100 1087426260 ???: First-choice PvE pick for Major Spec enemies particularly for Void Gyrfalcon Hunters in end-game content. Indebted Kindness is the first ever Rocket-Assisted Frame sidearm, so there's no comparison possible. It seems to be a weird mix of sidearm and grenade launcher, which hits like a truck. Blast Radius seems to be the most impactful stat so any of the barrel perks that help boost it are viable. For similar reasons, High-Explosive Ordnance is the top choice for the mag perk. The new-to-Season 23 Permeability trait in the second trait column means, if you're running Gyrfalcons, you can use Indebted Kindness to apply volatility at will - making this really strong against Barrier Champions as well as for add clear. You can pair this with Lead From Gold to help with ammo economy, Beacond Rounds for strong enemy tracking or Loose Change for speedy reloads, if you're using Gambler's Dodge. The origin trait is situationally useful if you're in a construct-heavy environment, like the Warlord's Ruin dungeon itself. Recommended MW: Blast Radius, with a damage boosting Major or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-boss, pve-major, pve-champion, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

// Loaded Question PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Ionized Battery, Enhanced Battery, Reservoir Burst
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 68 https://open.spotify.com/episode/7e93LMhFDUbZZX5SKYzXf0?si=cec8c26785114ffb with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Majors in end-game activities. Loaded Question is back, and has some interesting new combinations. Being a high-impact fusion rifle, there are only five bolts, so stability is slightly less of an issue - Fluted Barrel adds useful handling, and Hammer-Forged Rifling or Smallbore add Range as the barrel perk. There are traits which bypass reload time and work best with as large a magazine as possible, so Ionized or Enhanced Battery are the top battery choices. In the first trait slot as the support perk, Overflow doubles your magazine size just for running over a special ammo brick, or 7-8 rapid kills with another weapon overfills the magazine by up to 10 shots with Envious Assassin. Every shot in your overfilled mag, beyond it's normal limit, will trigger Reservoir Burst in the second trait slot as the signature perk, a Chain Reaction-type explosions on kills to clear adds, and +25% damage to burst down Majors and maybe the occasional boss DPS phase. Plus you can build into the Arc 3.0 blinding and jolting verb kit with an arc subclass, making this a bit of a PvE Swiss-Army Knife.

First-choice PvE pick for Anti-barrier Champion use in end-game activities. The reprised Messenger has a few new tricks for Season 21, which make it worth a look. Good stats across the board, except for recoil direction, which we can help out with Arrowhead Brake in the barrel slot, which takes it to a controllable 90. For use against Barrier Champions, Armor-Piercing Rounds adds 5% damage to shields and barrier, which is boosted a further 10% with Under-Over in the first trait slot as the support perk. In the second slot, the new-for-Lightfall Kinetic Tremors as the signature perk adds bonus AoE damage for 12 hits or four bursts, damaging the stunned Champion and any adds within 5m. If you're running solo content, don't forget the Alacrity origin trait to pretty much max out every stat on the board, and add 10 Aim Assist too.

// Zephyr PvE first-choice roll
// Jagged Edge, Tempered Edge, Swordmaster's Guard, Relentless Strike, Whirlwind Blade
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. PvE first-choice roll for for Majors and Bosses. No second origin trait, but Dawning Surprise helps you gain ability energy and restart healing by collecting a small box after killing a half-dozen enemies or so - ideal in keeping you alive in CQC. In the blade slot, Jagged Edge to maximises damage or Tempered Edge balances a bit of extra damage and ammo, for all-round utility. Swordmaster's Guard is the usual recommendation in the guard slot, to get your heavy attack up as quickly as possible. For groups and single target damage, Relentless Strikes helps with your ammo economy, while Whirldwind Blade builds up to 30% bonus damage after 10 hits - great for chunkier Minor add clear or a Major or Boss..

// Mechabre PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag, Perpetual Motion, Voltshot
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 37. PvE first-choice roll for building into Arc 3.0 subclasses. The Origin Trait, gaining better ADS and strafe speed when on your own, might be useful when you're away from your fireteam, but think of it more as a useful added extra when it's procced. Direct competitor to Occluded Finality, but with a much more reasonable 45 Zoom. You don't really need to worry about range, so look no further than Fluted Barrel to boost Handling and Stability. You want to make your reloads as fast as possible, so Flared Magwell or Tactical Mag are you mag choices. In the first trait column, Perpetual Motion boosts Reload Speed even more so that when you get your first add kill, you can reload as fast as possible to proc Jolt with Voltshot in the second column for additional damage against a Major or Boss and add clear of any Minors nearby. This is as close as you'll get to a legendary Cloudstrike. Recommended MW: Reload Speed, with a damage-boosting Major, Boss or Taken Spec mod.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for burst damage against majors and Champions in end-game content. Shapeable. An end-game LFR that you don't need to complete a Raid, Dungeon or Trials for, which works for both burst and sustained damage, especially with the Veist Stinger origin trait throwing in extra shots for free at random. A Handling barrel just makes using it snappier, and Enhanced Battery adds a shot with no downsides, to give the origin trait an extra chance to proc. For solo or against more mobile bosses, take your choice of Clown Cartridge, Triple Tap or Field Prep with Frenzy, so you don't need to worry about how close your are to the rest of your fireteam.

The Origin Perk is aimed at playing with a fireteam - the larger, the better your magazine size after reload will be. The only High-Impact Stasis LMG available as at v6.2.0.6, but comparing to other HIs, the stats are a mixed bunch.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 31. PvE first-choice roll for endgame content. The Origin Perk works well in CQC, and in particular for melee-heavy playstyles. High-ish stats make this fairly competitive in slot if you don't look too closely at Heritage, anyway. You can never go wrong with a bit more range from your barrel, and faster fire rate, or an extra round in the mag and better reload speed. For endgame content, Triple Tap keeps the bullets coming, and Surrounded provides a huge boost to CQC damage, complimenting the origin perk, and will help with damage against champions when the mod is in town.

Another opportunity to get a kinetic Blinding Grenade Launcher, if you haven't already - an essential tool in any end-game toolbox.

// Retold Tale PvE first-choice roll
// Full Choke, Tactical Mag, Assault Mag, Slideshot, One-Two Punch
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 23. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Still worth looking at, even without an origin perk, with the update 4.1.5 buff to pellet shotguns. For boss damage, Full Choke keeps pellets together, Tactical Mag maximises magazine size with some additional useful buffs too, or Assault Mag allows for a quicker follow up shot if you miss a pellet with your first. The Slideshot gets you reloads on the fly and One-Two Punch is still good for major and boss damage - if you can get close enough!

// The Call First-choice PvE
// Quick Launch, Volatile Launch, Linear Compensator, Tactical Mag, High-Velocity Rounds, High-Explosive Ordnance, Subsistence, Lead from Gold, One for All
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 106 from 18 June 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/0GYlriUxhFqNHGLqb84C1G?si=bb5a2c9b339d4c35 with @ImpetusAlways, @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for Minor and Major add clearing in end-game content. Shapeable. The Call is the best weapon to come from the Pale Heart weapon set. There's only one other rocket-assisted frame, so there's not much to compare against, but the stats don't honestly matter. You'd normally look for velocity in a non-hitscan weapon, but there's an argument to be made for blast radius too so the barrel and mag perk choices depend on your preference although be aware that High-Explosive Ordnance will reduce the base mag size to 9. This is going to one-hit kill red bars in most content, so Subsistence is a good choice to bypass reloading entirely, or Lead from Gold will help with the already good ammo economy in the first trait perk column. In the second, One for All can proc from AoE damage ticks - which is why you might want to focus on blast radius - for +35% bonus damage for 10s. The Dealer's Choice origin trait is nice to have who doesn't love more super energy? - with two or three Pale Heart weapons, you'll notice the difference!

First-choice PvE pick for burst DPS against Majors and Champions in end-game content. Shapeable. Someday has in-band stats and is the only kinetic precision frame shotgun currently available. As per usual, Look for handling, or a touch of extra range without any penalties in the barrel perk, and Assault Mag or maybe Tactical Mag in the magazine slot. As the support perk in the first trait column, Threat Detector and Lead for Gold are viable options, or the new Threat Remover looks interesting. Then in the second column, this is the only non-Raid shotgun, and the first pellet shotgun, that can roll with Recombination, which adds up to +100% damage to the next shot, ideal for tanky enemies. The Dealer's Choice origin trait is nice to have who doesn't love more super energy? - with two or three Pale Heart weapons, you'll notice the difference!

First-choice PvE pick for backup DPS against Majors and Bosses in end-game content. Shapeable. If you don't already have a fusion rifle for backup DPS, Axial Lacuna is available and shapeable. If you're interested, a lacuna is a gap or blank space, so the name refers to something missing in the direction of an axis. Improve your handling with your barrel perk, and then with your battery, Accelerated Coils is probably the top choice, but there's also something to be said for the extra shots you'll get from Enhanced Battery. there's nothing better than Reconstruction in the first trait perk slot, doubling your battery's capacity for a damage phase. In the second trait slot, Controlled Burst is the go-to trait for bonus damage, both adding +20% damage and reducing charge time for just landing all your bolts.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing in end-game content. Shapeable. Pro Memoria - which means "for memory" in Latin, and is also the name for a formal note embodying the written record of a diplomatic discussion - is the first in a new aggressive frame LMG subtype. It's described as "high damage", so should be good in a few different roles but with high recoil, look to the 	 to provide help with control and a little extra handling. As the magazine perk, Ricichet Rounds helps a little more with recoil control, or you can use High-Caliber or Armor-Piercing Rounds for additional combat effects. As a "heavy scout rifle" for add clearing, it never hurts to have a bigger mag, so you can use Reconstruction or Envious Assassin in the first trait slot, and then Desperate Measures is easy to proc with Transcendent for up to +30% damage, you should be creating plenty of strand tangles to proc Collective Action's +20% damage, or Frenzy is a reliable +15% plus maxxed handling and reload speed.

// Pro Memoria First-choice PvE
// Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Polygonal Rifling, Smallbore, Ricochet Rounds, High-Caliber Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Hatchling, Desperate Measures, Collective Action, Frenzy
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 106 from 18 June 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/0GYlriUxhFqNHGLqb84C1G?si=bb5a2c9b339d4c35 with @ImpetusAlways, @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing in end-game content, particularly with Strand fragments. Shapeable. Pro Memoria - which means "for memory" in Latin, and is also the name for a formal note embodying the written record of a diplomatic discussion - is the first in a new aggressive frame LMG subtype. It's described as "high damage", so should be good in a few different roles but with high recoil, look to the barrel perk to provide help with control and a little extra handling. As the magazine perk, for sustained boss damage, you'll want a perk that increases mag size or possibly helps a little more with recoil control. As a "heavy scout rifle" to use with Strand fragments, you should be getting easy headshot add kills to spawn threadlings with the Hatchling trait perk in the first column. Then Desperate Measures is easy to proc with Transcendent for up to +30% damage, you should be creating plenty of strand tangles to proc Collective Action's +20% damage, or Frenzy is a reliable +15% plus maxxed handling and reload speed. The Dealer's Choice origin trait is nice to have who doesn't love more super energy? - with two or three Pale Heart weapons, you'll notice the difference! Recommended MW: Stability or Handling, with a Backup Mag mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-major, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

// False Idols First-choice PvE
// Jagged Edge, Honed Edge, Tempered Edge, Swordmaster's Guard, Relentless Strikes, Bait and Switch, Surrounded
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 106 from 18 June 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/0GYlriUxhFqNHGLqb84C1G?si=bb5a2c9b339d4c35 with @ImpetusAlways, @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for sustained Boss damage in end-game content. Shapeable. False Idols is the latest vortex frame sword, and as all swords have pretty much the same stats, this is definitely in-band. Like all vortex frames, it's not currently good for boss damage with the cost/benefit of the spin-to-win heavy attack but if you want to save one for a possible future buff, start with a blade perk that boosts damage. In the guard perk slot, Swordmaster's Guard just buffs a little bit of everything. Then, in the first trait perk slot, Relentless Strikes passively returns ammo on hits while, in the second, Bait and Switch adds +30% damage when procced, or in the right circumstances, Surrounded adds +35% damage +41.75% when enhanced. The Dealer's Choice origin trait is nice to have who doesn't love more super energy? - with two or three Pale Heart weapons, you'll notice the difference!

In the guard perk slot, Swordmaster's Guard just buffs a little bit of everything. Then, in the first trait perk slot, Incandescent is very good a clearing crowds, particularly with solar fragments that use scorch or ignite, and then Chain Reaction, while not great for damage with the poor sword damage multiplier, can spread scorch and soften up add-dense crowds, or One for All can boost damage by +35% for dealing with a smaller number of beefier enemies.

// Elsie's Rifle Shiny PvE first-choice roll
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 102 from 23 April 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/5kuhrmYKBDwvLtzZJQmxiK?si=7f73118bec6743ac with @Saint_Kabr, @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for tackling Barrier Champions in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. A D1 blast from the past, Elsie's Rifle has great stats and the frame adds accuracy for firing when stationery or not moving much. First, a little extra recoil direction with the barrel perk will help controlling shots. Maybe a little niche, but add together Armor-Piercing Rounds, Under-Over and the extra damage from Frenzy, and you have a great option for piercing Barrier Champions. If the pulse rifle mod isn't around, Gyrfalcon Hunters can take advantage of on-demand volatile rounds to make this a year-round option. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade of melle energy according to your subclass type. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a damage boosting Boss or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-boss, pve-champion, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

First-choice PvE pick for burst damege against Major and Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. First thing to say is if you already have the DSC raid version, you're already covered. If not, this is an excellent kinetic frame sniper rifle with pretty much best in-subfamily stats. The best rolls are more for burst damage against majors and stunned Champions. Fluted Barrel adds handling and stability, or go all-in to stability with Polygonal Rifling. You can use Tactical Mag to add stability and reload speed, or maximise your magazine size with Extended Mag and Backup Mag. For Majors, Reconstruction will double your magazine size so you can get up to 10 in the mag with Extended Mag and a Backup Mag mod, and Recombination give you an Izanagi-lite first shot with up to 100% bonus damage, Firing Line provides a passive 20% bonus crit damage in a fireteam or, if you're running solo, Focused Fury can proc after three crit his, so your remaining shots have 20% bonus damage, or Vorpal Weapon is just a straight 15% damage against Majors and Bosses.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 102 from 23 April 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/5kuhrmYKBDwvLtzZJQmxiK?si=7f73118bec6743ac with @Saint_Kabr, @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The meme-machine is back and, although the stats are average, it's a beast for boss damage. Go for a barrel perk that boosts Velocity and Handling, and Augmented Drum as the mag park adds an extra shot. As the first trait perk, Auto-Loading Holster bypasses Augmented Drum's reload penalty or Field Prep just negates it, and Explosive Light adds +25% damage - when enhanced, this will apply to all 7 shots before reloading. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade of melle energy according to your subclass type.

// Edge Transit PvE first-choice roll
// Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control, Augmented Drum, Auto-Loading Holster, Field Prep, Explosive Light
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 102 from 23 April 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/5kuhrmYKBDwvLtzZJQmxiK?si=7f73118bec6743ac with @Saint_Kabr, @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The meme-machine is back and, although the stats are average, it's a beast for boss damage. Go for a barrel perk that boosts Velocity and Handling, and Augmented Drum as the mag park adds an extra shot. As the first trait perk, Auto-Loading Holster bypasses Augmented Drum's reload penalty or Field Prep just negates it, and Explosive Light adds +25% damage - when enhanced, this will apply to all 7 shots before reloading. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade of melle energy according to your subclass type. Recommended MW: Velocity or Handling, with a damage boosting Major, Boss or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-boss, pve-major, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

// Falling Guillotine Shiny PvE first-choice roll

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Falling Guillotine is a decent, legendary choice for boss damage, particularly now that the BRAVE version can roll with two damage perks. As usual, look for a blade perk that boosts impact, and then Swordmaster's Guard as the guard perk for a bit of everything useful. In the first trait column, Frenzy provides the largest passive damage bonus of +15%, but Vorpal Weapon is still +10% or the old classic Relentless Strikes will extend sword ammo. In the second trait column, Surrounded provides +35% damage +42% when enhanced but only when in a crowd, or both Bait and Switch and Whirlwind Blade provide +30% when procced. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade of melle energy according to your subclass type.

First-choice PvE pick for Major and Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. The Other Half returns with a few new perks, so if you haven't got one yet Dares of Eternity awaits! Boost the damage with the blade perk, and then Swordmaster's Guard adds a little bit of everything useful. While Eager Edge was the unique Dares perk back in the day, it's appeared elsewhere since so Relentless Strikes is probably the more sensible first column trait perk to combine with Surrounded in the second for 35% 41.8% when enhanced bonus damage when in a crowd. The Hot Swap origin trait is always useful for boosting charge time and guarding stats when you first swap to it.

// The Slammer PvE first-choice roll
// Jagged Edge, Honed Edge, Tempered Edge, Swordmaster's Guard, Relentless Strikes, Bait and Switch
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 101 from 17 April 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/1CJQuqM89I7hWA9KYvjCop?si=arncPmZ1SseRp6Atuf1ilw with @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage to Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The Slammer is our first vortex frame Stasis sword, with the same stats as its peers. Boost the damage with the blade perk, and then Swordmaster's Guard adds a little bit of everything useful. For boss damage, the combination of Relentless Strikes and Bait and Switch has you covered, adding 30% damage for 10s. You'll probably find more use for the Vanguard's Vindication origin trait, unless there's a champion mod around for swords that works with Stunning Recovery. Recommended MW: Impact, with a damage boosting Major, Boss or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-boss, pve-major, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

// A Sudden Death PvE first-choice roll

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Minor and Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. A Sudden Death returns as void, rather than arc shotgun with the rather poor stats you'd expect from a Year 1 gun. If you already have a burst damage void shotgun then feel free to pass as it's likely a fair bit better. If you are making do, then Barrel Shroud or Corkscrew Rifling pad out the Handling stats a little as the barrel perk, and Assault Mag speeds up shots, or Tactical Mag adds one to the mag as the magazine perk. You could take your choice of either Threat Detector's Handling and Reload buffs or Envious Assassin for an overflowed magazine to start an engagement with. Trench Barrel bumps up damage by 50% for three shots when procced - although you'll obviously need to be right up close to take advantage! The Crossing Over origin trait is useful all around for PvE, with bumps to range and handling in the top half of a magazine, and a small 3% damage boost at the bottom.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major or Boss spec enemies in end-game content. As an aggressive RL, Crux Termination IV is in the highest damage category of rocket launchers, along with adaptive-frames, and has the highest velocity in its peer group to boot. You can look on the low blast radius as an advantage for boss fights, as you can get a bit closer without being killing yourself in the explosion. There's no Field Prep option, so you start off with 1 in the mag and 7 reserves, with one more rocket for each chest ammo reserve mod. Go for the highest velocity you can with the barrel perk and then, for boss damage, Impact Casing is always the best option. In the first trait column, you could look at Envious Assassin - up to three in the tube after 11 kills with other weapons. Alternatively Reconstruction passively provides 2 in the tube over the course of 8s, or Clown Cartridge does the same on a manual reload. For major or boss damage, Explosive Light provides up to 6 shots with +25% damage.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Majors or sustained damage against Boss spec enemies in end-game content. As an aggressive RL, Crux Termination IV is in the highest damage category of rocket launchers, along with adaptive-frames, and has the highest velocity in its peer group to boot. You can look on the low blast radius as an advantage for boss fights, as you can get a bit closer without being killing yourself in the explosion. With one eye on Bipod as the second column trait, as there's no Field Prep option, you'll start off with 2 in the mag and 12 reserves, with one more rocket for each chest ammo reserve mod. Go for the highest velocity you can with the barrel perk and then, for boss damage, Impact Casing is always the best option. In the first trait column, you could look at Envious Assassin - up to five in the tube after 11 kills with other weapons. Alternatively Reconstruction passively provides 4 in the tube at the rate of one every 4s, or Clown Cartridge provides 3 or 4 after a manual reload. For burst and sustained Boss damage, Bipod just about breaks even with 25% less damage and slower reloads, but faster firing and more reserve ammo.

// Double-Edged Answer PvE first-choice roll
// Jagged Edge, Honed Edge, Tempered Edge, Burst Guard, Balanced Guard, Cross Counter, Counterattack
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 93 https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uYGSQqlyX1faCyATCDuno?si=IMSCRgTRQr-_THJdjxFMIQ with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies, or Boss spec enemies with short damage windows in end-game content. Double-Edged Answer has awful base stats and a huge perk pool so, if you are looking for a roll, reset your Vanguard reputation a few times first. Jagged Edge provides the most damage as a Blade perk, but decimates your ammo, so Honed Edge and Tempered Edge might be attractive alternatives. For this roll, you'll be looking to block damage, so a Guard perk like Burst Guard or Balanced Guard works best. This is the only sword dropping in S23 with the combination of Flash Counter and Counterattack - get in close to a tanky enemy to bait them into a melee/slam attack, and then the combination of weaken and bonus damage provides +80% damage for 2s, and +20% for the next two, which should be enough time to put a serious dent in their health bar. Nadir Focus could be an interesting mini-Eager Edge - each light attack increases lunge distance, if you want some fun.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major spec enemies in end-game content. Unfortunately, Retrofuturist is distinctly meh, so it's only worth hanging onto a roll if it fills a hole in your vault, and even then you'll have to reset your Crucible rank a few times to stand a decent chance of the roll you're after. As a Lightweight shotgun, you do get the +20 mobility and +6.25% movement speed and, for some reason, it has a base mags size of 7, but that's where the praise ends. If you're hanging onto one, try a barrel perk that adds Handling, although a bit of range and stability doesn't hurt either. Assault Mag and Tactical Mag are the best mag perk choices, but Appended Mag or Light Mag aren't bad. For burst damage against majors, the trait combination of Auto-Loading Holster and Trench Barrel is decent enough.

// Supercluster PvE first-choice roll
// Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Assault Mag, Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Fourth Time's the Charm, Reconstruction, Thread Detector, Lead From Gold, Surrounded, Vorpal Weapon
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 92 https://open.spotify.com/episode/2qpoxXfXzBXohHBrdQnHbd?si=aH9jqq3kRwOtwQoh2YhHDA with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for fallback damage against Boss spec in end-game content. Shapeable. Supercluster is the first Strand pinpoint slug shotgun, and the good news is it has very competitive stats. The bad news is that they're not as great as they were a few years ago for boss DPS, but you might want to keep one just in case, if you don't have a slug shotty already. Use the barrel perk to boost range and the mag perk to improve its utility - your preference between Assault Mag or Tactical Mag, or Appended Mag. If you're looking for a backup DPS weapon, then a reloading perk in the first trait column - Fourth Time's The Charm, Reconstruction, Threat Detector, or Lead From Gold for you ammo economy are all possible. For a damage boosting perk in the second trait slot, choose between Surrounded, if you're likely to be in CQC with extra adds, or Vorpal Weapon for a reliable 15% boost to damage against Majors and Bosses. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red or an ally dies. You'll get a reload and 11s of a boost to range and either charge rate or handling. Recommended MW: Range, with a damage boosting Major, Boss or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-boss, pve-major, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

// Retold Tale PvE first-choice roll
// Full Choke, Barrel Shroud, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Tactical Mag, Assault Mag, Light Mag, Appended Mag, Lead from Gold, Slideshot, One-Two Punch
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 91 https://open.spotify.com/episode/50NPk7xF3Tt6X3DVucE9jU?si=44d2b7d44a5a4aec with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage to Major Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly for melee builds. Retold Tale has okay stats compared to other precision frame shotguns and the trait pool is weighted towards PvP, but there's still some nice combinations here. First, for the barrel perk, Full Choke keeps the pellet spread tighter, or Barrel Shroud, Smallbore or Corkscrew Rifling all add useful stats and for the mag slot while Tactical Mag or Assault Mag are the top two choices, Light Mag or Appended Mag aren't bad alternatives. If you don't already have a One-Two Punch Shotgun, then this can work - Lead From Gold to keep your ammo topped off, or Slideshot for instant slide reloads in the first trait column to support One-Two Punch in the second to pair with an aggressive melee-focussed build for burst damage against Majors, including stunned Champions. The Advanced Reflexes origin trait is quite useful in PvE - when activated by an enemy hit, it adds +30 Handling for additional ready and ADS speed, together with a handy +20 Mobility, for 7.5s. Recommended MW: Range or Stability, with a damage boosting Major or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-boss, pve-major, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

// Albedo Wing PvE first-choice roll
//notes: Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 91 https://open.spotify.com/episode/50NPk7xF3Tt6X3DVucE9jU?si=44d2b7d44a5a4aec with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content with an arc subclass. Only the second Aggressive Glaive subtype so there's not much of a comparison to make, but Albedo Wing seems to have decent stats. The range is good, so you can focus on the shield duration stat with the haft perk for major damage reduction in PvE. The reload speed is poor, and Light Mag is the only perk that helps. In the first trait column, Clown Cartridge can overflow the magazine on reload to 5 or 6, and there are plenty of arc grenades the glaive melee doesn't count unfortunately, to proc the second stack of Golden Tricorn with for a 50% damage boost for 10s. The Dawning Surprise origin trait is very useful in PvE - when the behind the scenes counter hits 100, the surprise is spawned on the ground for 10s and grants 10% energy to all abilities, grants 20HP and starts shield/health regeneration. Recommended MW: Reload Speed or Shield Duraction, with a damage boosting Major or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-boss, pve-major, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec or Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Grab Glacioclasm while you can - unusually, for a world-drop weapon it has great stats as a High-Impact fusion rifle. Only firing five bolts, it's a bit more controllable than faster-firing subtypes, so spec into range with the barrel perk. In the battery perk slot, you're aiming to get as many shots as possible, with Ionized or Extended Battery. For the first trait perk, there's really only one to consider, and that's Overflow to instantly double your battery size for picking up ammo. Combine that with Controlled Burst in the second trait slot for DPS that'll hold up as a burst damage weapon against Majors or a backup weapon for boss damage phases.

// Avalanche PvE first-choice roll

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing chunkier Minor Spec, and Major Spec enemies in end-game content. The stats are okay overall - there are a could of surprises with 90 Aim Assist and 19 Zoom, which are a lot higher than its peers - but unfortunately Avalanche has the lowest ammo reserves of any adaptive which limits its usefulness. If you already have a decent solar LMG, then you can pass. If you don't, Arrowhead Brake cleans up the recoil direction to 100, or Smallbore or Fluted Barrel boost useful stats as the barrel perk. Then, Appended Mag, Extended Mag or Flared Magwell can all work as mag perks. Finally, the SOFA Stats/ One For All traint combination layers on more useful stats and a chunky 35% damage boost for 10s when procced. The Dawning Surprise origin trait is very useful in PvE - when the behind the scenes counter hits 100, the surprise is spawned on the ground for 10s and grants 10% energy to all abilities, grants 20HP and starts shield/health regeneration.

// Zephyr PvE first-choice roll
// Jagged Edge, HonedEdge, Tempered Edge, Swordmaster's Guard, Relentless Strikes, Surrounded
//notes: Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 91 https://open.spotify.com/episode/50NPk7xF3Tt6X3DVucE9jU?si=44d2b7d44a5a4aec with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Zephyr's stats are much like any other adaptive sword, except the DSC raid-drop Bequest. For single target damage it doesn't really do anything that other swords don't already cover, but if you don't have one yet for boss damage, the additional damage from Jagged Edge is the best choice, although Honed Edge and Tempered Edge are decent alternatives. Swordmaster's Guard is the usual recommendation for swords, but don't discount other guards that help with guarding stats as you'll be up close and will probably need the damage resistance. For burst damage, Relentless Strikes returns ammo on every third hit and Surrounded boosts damage by 35% if there are enemies nearby - this can be useful in crowded boss fights. The Dawning Surprise origin trait is very useful in PvE - when the behind the scenes counter hits 100, the surprise is spawned on the ground for 10s and grants 10% energy to all abilities, grants 20HP and starts shield/health regeneration.

@title:Season 23 Warlord's Ruin weapons
@description:New weapons dropping from the Warlord's Ruin dungeon, with the Sundering origin trait

// Vengeful Whisper PvE first-choice roll
// Elastic String, Fiberglass Arrow Shaft, Straight Fletching, Slice, Precision Instrument
//notes: Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 90 https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C3Wx7xXVw10WshiLn5sT8?si=ZNEiHi_ZRfW5z3BbkOMrVQ with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways, and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for support against Major and Boss spec enemies in end-game content. Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Vengeful Whisper is no exception - even going as far as an extra point of zoom over other precision bows. This also has traits appearing in non-standard columns to make for some unique rolls. As with every bow, the aim is to reduce draw time first, and improve accuracy second - Elastic String does the first job and Fiberglass Arrow Shaft or Straight Fletching does the second. The combination of Slice in the first trait column and Precision Instrument in the second could make for an interesting combination to apply Sever to majors and bosses from range - even when they're immune to damage - to reduce their damage output by 40% for 10s or 15s with Thread of Continuity effectively a 40% DR for the whole fireteam as well as doing decent, for a primary weapon, damage with the boost from Precision Instrument. The origin trait is situationally useful if you're in a construct-heavy environment, like the Warlord's Ruin dungeon itself.

// Naeem's Lance PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Extended Mag, Reconstruction, Slice
//notes: Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 90 https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C3Wx7xXVw10WshiLn5sT8?si=ZNEiHi_ZRfW5z3BbkOMrVQ with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways, and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for against Major or Boss Spec enemies, particularly with Strand subcalsses, in end-game content. Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Naeem's Lance is no exception, having pretty good overall stats. It's the first Rapid-fire Sniper so, as is common for most snipers, Handling is a crucial stat but, as this is a rapid-fire frame, you'll also need to tidy up the recoil direction, so Arrowhead Brake is the barrel perk choice, taking the stat to a manageable 84. As the mag perk, Tactical Mag is the best option, as it boosts stability a bit too, and gives the same rounds in the mag seven as Appended and Extended Mag, but either of those work too. For the first trait, Reconstruction doubles your mag size passively, while Slice in the second trait makes this possibly the best special weapon to pair with a Bait and Switch heavy weapon - reducing the Severed target's damage output by 40% for 10s 15s with Thread of Continuity if you're using a Strand subclass - an effective additional 40% DR for your whole fireteam. The origin trait is situationally useful if you're in a construct-heavy environment, like the Warlord's Ruin dungeon itself.

First-choice PvE pick for Major Spec enemies particularly for Arc subclasses in end-game content. Indebted Kindness is the first ever Rocket-Assisted Frame sidearm, so there's no comparison possible. It seems to be a weird mix of sidearm and grenade launcher, which hits like a truck. Blast Radius seems to be the most impactful stat so any of the barrel perks that help boost it are viable. For similar reasons, High-Explosive Ordnance is the top choice for the mag perk. Voltshot, as the second trait perk, should make it easy to apply Jolt to a target and help clear adds quickly, but relies on a fast reload - Impulse Amplifier as the first trait perk helps all the time or, after your first application of Voltshot, Loose Change boosts reload speed by 50. Throw on other fragments like Spark of Beacons for additional blinding to suppress adds, or Ions/Discharge to feed your abilities and this could be a top choice for crowd control.

// Dragoncult Sickle PvE first-choice roll
// Jagged Edge, Swordmaster's Guard, Slice, Surrounded, Whirlwind Blade
//notes: Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 90 https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C3Wx7xXVw10WshiLn5sT8?si=ZNEiHi_ZRfW5z3BbkOMrVQ with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways, and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for Major and Boss Spec enemies particularly for Strand subclasses in end-game content. This is the first new Caster-Frame sword we've seen in some time, and the first Strand one. Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Dragoncult Sickle is no exception, having pretty good overall stats - both Impact and Ammo Capacity are higher than its peers. The advantage you have with caster frames is that you can hit from range with the heavy attack, but the ammo cost as at v7.3.0.3 is still a little high. On the other hand, you can use it for major or boss damage - the standard Jagged Edge for the extra damage and Swordmaster's Guard for the Blade and Guard perks still apply. The new-to-Season-23 Slice as the first trait perk gives this an ability to sever a major or a boss, reducing its outgoing damage by 40% for 10s or 15s with Thread of Continuity, which can be a lifesaver in a CQC fight. In the second trait column as the signature perk, you could go for Surrounded, if you know there will be adds around to boost damage by 40%, or Whirlwind Blade if there aren't. The origin trait is situationally useful if you're in a construct-heavy environment, like the Warlord's Ruin dungeon itself.

// Mechabre PvE first-choice roll

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Mechabre it's so obviously a pun on Macabre, so let's just pronounce it Mech-ah-bruh is reportedly excellent in PvP, but like all aggressive snipers it struggles to find a role in PvE. One thing you could do is use it to apply jolt to beefier targets at a distance. As with most snipers, look for a handling-boosting barrel perk. Building towards the end, Flared Magwell gives the biggest boost to reload speed out of the magazine perks, with Tactical Mag a decent alternative. Keep Away in the first trait column as the support perk boosts reload speed by a further 30, as well as boosting range and accuracy all of which, with a reload Masterwork, can get the reload speed up to 85. Get one kill against an add, reload and then Voltshot in the second column as the signature perk can apply jolt to your next target from a safe distance for burst and AoE damage. The Search Party origin trait is more PvP-orientated, but faster ADS speed is always nice to have.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. If you weren't around to shape your own Regnant, and don't have a decently-rolled Explosive Light grenade launcher, Acosmic named after one of the two Hindu aspects of god; to be acosmic is to deny the objective reality of the temporal world - transcendental in a world-negating sense, according to Merriam-Webster is a void rapid-fire frame GL, with the intrinsic 20% faster reload when its magazine is empty, and is a viable option. Use the barrel perk to get shots to the target as fast as possible, and Spike Grenades adds 13.3% to total damage for a direct hit in the magazine slot. In the first column, for the support trait perk, saves a reserves perk on your chest and significantly boosts reload when you crouch. Explosive Light is the second column as the signature perk adds +52.5% to total damage for up to six shots for great burst damage, as well as boosting the blast radius to 100 - great against Majors surrounded by minor adds. The Nadir Focus origin trait boosts your shot velocity further, which is a nice little bonus.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 79 https://open.spotify.com/episode/1qz5FD88RfmGHDjedV6nGo?si=7e1c1558ecea4f1c with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for melee builds and burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. Swordbreaker is back as a strand shotgun, has good stats - particularly the ones that matter most - and like all lightweights offers +20 Mobility and +6.25% movement speed. In the barrel perk slot, Full Choke improves pellet spread which is important for later. For the mag perk, Tactical Mag increases the magazine by one and boosts reload speed or Assault Mag improves rate-of-fire. To make the most of the Cursed Thrall origin trait, which synergises well with melee builds and is a lot of fun for helping soften up groups of enemies when active, Pugilist is an obvious choice in the first trait column as the support perk, regenerating melee energy on weapon kills. In the second column as the signature perk, One-Two Punch is great for burst damage against a major or a champion, or even the occasional boss for melee-based builds. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a damage boosting Major, Boss or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-boss, pve-major, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies and sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. There's a lot of competition in the arc LMGs, and Song of Ir Yût has lower than average stats but saves itself with some nice trait perk combinations. Handling makes most weapons feel better - Fluted Barrel adds the most, but Arrowhead Brake also helps max out the recoil direction in the barrel perk slot. Maximise your magazine size with Extended Mag or Appended Mag as the perk, and then in the first column as the support perk, you can then make the most of this with Rewind Rounds or Reconstruction so you can essentially keep firing til you run out of ammo. With this set-up, you can use Bait-and-Switch as the second column signature perk for 10s of +35% damage, which is great for shorter boss damage phases think Caretaker in Vow. Maybe not so useful with this roll, but the Cursed Thrall origin perk synergises well with melee builds and is a lot of fun for helping soften up groups of enemies when active.

// Song of Ir Yût Adept PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Extended Mag, Appended Mag, Rewind Rounds, Reconstruction, Target Lock
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 79 https://open.spotify.com/episode/1qz5FD88RfmGHDjedV6nGo?si=7e1c1558ecea4f1c with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Barrel and Mag re-shapeable. There's a lot of competition in the arc LMGs, and Song of Ir Yût has lower than average stats but saves itself with some nice trait perk combinations. Handling makes most weapons feel better - Fluted Barrel adds the most, but Arrowhead Brake also helps max out the recoil direction in the barrel perk slot. Maximise your magazine size with Extended Mag or Appended Mag as the perk, and then in the first column as the support perk, you can then make the most of this with Rewind Rounds or Reconstruction so you can essentially keep firing til you run out of ammo. With this set-up, you can reach the highest stacks of +40% damage woth Target Lock as the second column signature perk, which is great for sustained boss damage phases. Maybe not so useful with this roll, but the Cursed Thrall origin perk synergises well with melee builds and is a lot of fun for helping soften up groups of enemies when active. Recommended MW: Handling or Range, with a damage boosting Adept Big Ones or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-boss, pve-major, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

// Deadpan Delivery PvE first-choice roll
// Full Choke, Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Extended Mag, Overflow, One-Two Punch
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 78 https://open.spotify.com/episode/5KOQQ9QtvSEhRVb4vjeO3B?si=8c4784e02b87424e with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major or Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Decent stats in comparison with its peers. So if you're a Lethal Current Hunter in the market for a shotgun to pair with your melee, Deadpan Delivery is a very decent choice. For a One-Two Punch roll, start with Full Choke, to make hitting all your pellets a little easier. Tactical Mag increases the magazine to a maximum of 5 which is the same as Appended and Extended Mags. Then, as the first trait column support perk, there's no Grave Robber unfortunately, but Overflow doubles your magazine size for picking up ammo, which gives you 10 shots before you'll have to reload unless you pickup another ammo brick. Finally, One-Two Punch in the second column as the signature perk boosts your powered melee damage by a hefty 40%. You probably won't get much use out of the Nadir Focus Origin Trait, which adds range and accuracy on repeated hits, but it is nice to have anyway.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major enemies in end-game content. Decent stats in comparison with its peers. If you're looking for an arc shotgun, Deadpan Delivery is a very decent choice. Start with a barrel perk that boosts handling - Barrel Shroud or Corkscrew Rifling both help a little - and Assault Mag improves the low rate of fire. In the first trait column as the support perk, Overflow doubles your magazine size for just picking up an ammo brick and then in the second column signature perk slot, to passively boost damage for end-game use you could use Trench Barrel, Frenzy or Collective Action. You probably won't get much use out of the Nadir Focus Origin Trait, which adds range and accuracy on repeated hits, but it is nice to have anyway.

// Nox Perennial V PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Liquid Coils, Ionised Battery, Accelerated Coils, Envious Assassin, Controlled Burst
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 78 https://open.spotify.com/episode/5KOQQ9QtvSEhRVb4vjeO3B?si=8c4784e02b87424e with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major enemies and sustained damage against Bosses in end-game content. In case you're wondering, the name translates as "enduring" or "recurring" night - Nox Perennial is the first high-impact fusion rifle and, although the stats aren't top notch, this roll is worth watching for, for Majors and Boss phases for when you're running Tractor Cannon, say. As with all high-impacts, the handling is terrible - Arrowhead Brake adds a moderate amount as well as taking the recoil direction to 95, but Fluted Barrel and Corkscrew Rifling are decent alternatives. You could go in a couple of different directions with the battery perk - Ionic Battery adds two shots don't worry about the reload speed penalty, we can deal with that later, or Accelerated Coils ups the first rate, but Liquid Coils is probably the top choice - again we'll use a trait to reduce the charge time from three business days to something more usable. In the first trait column as the support perk, Envious Assassin can boost the battery to 15 charges with 14 rapid kills with other weapons, while Controlled Burst adds 20% damage while reducing charge time for hitting all your bolts. The Wild Card origin trait is great for PvE - the occasional drop of Telesto-like "Experimental submunitions" on a kill for a bit of free additional damage.

// Psi Hermetic V PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Chambered Compensator, Extended Barrel, Fluted Barrel, Smallbore, Accurized Rounds, Tactical Mag, Enlightened Action, Headstone
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 78 https://open.spotify.com/episode/5KOQQ9QtvSEhRVb4vjeO3B?si=8c4784e02b87424e with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for Stasis synergy and add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. The name's a bit confusing - Psi Ψ is the 23rd letter in the Greek Alphabet, and Hermetic can mean something that's occult or mysterious and difficult to understand, relating to the legendary alchemist Hermes Trismegistus, tightly sealed, immune to external influence, or solitary like a hermit, so your guess is as good as anyone's. Anyway, this is a Stasis High Impact pulse rifle with decent stats. Look for something that helps with recoil direction, handling, stability or a mix as the barrel perk, and add range with Accurized Rounds or the useful gunfeel boosts of Tactical Mag. The traits are a bit PvP focussed - Enlightened Action is the best of the first column support perks, for big boosts to handling and reload speed with just two 3-bullet bursts. For Stasis synergy, Headstone generates a crystal on a crit kill, to use to proc your subclass fragments. The Wild Card origin trait is great for PvE - the occasional drop of Telesto-like "Experimental submunitions" on a kill for a bit of free additional damage.

// Luna Regolith III PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling, Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Extended Mag, Triple Tap, Clown Cartridge, Field Prep, Explosive Rounds, Firing Line
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5 with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Named after the unconsolidated debris that covers the moon's surface, the first thing to say is that, if you already have a decently rolled Aggressive Sniper Rifle in the hope that they get a touch of love in a future balance pass, you can move along as there's nothing to see here. The stats are weak in a currently as at v7.2.0.3 weak subtype, but if you're looking for a more easily obtained weapon, it's still very usable. It's a Vanguard weapon, so there is a huge trait pool - if you do want the best chance of a usable drop, reset your ranks a few times first, before you focus your engrams. As with all Sniper Rifles, Handling is king - there should be time between shots for the reticule to settle, so you don't need so much stability, making Fluted Barrel the top choice, with Arrowhead Brake, and Corkscrew Rifling as alternates. Tactical Mag gets you four in the mag, which is the same as Appended or Extended, so is the top choice there although Extended Mag + Backup Mag does get you to 5 total. In the first trait column as your support perk, you can make an argument for Triple Tap or Clown Cartridge, both of which can get you to 5 shots without reload with a base mag of 4, or 7/8 shots if the base mag is 5. Alternatively, Field Prep speeds up reloads and boosts reserve ammo. In the second trait column, as your signature perk, Explosive Payload is the best option for additional damage for solo play, or Firing Line works in a fireteam. While it's not a game-changer, the origin trait's Wild Card submunitions can be fun to help damage nearby adds on a kill.

// Semiotician PvE first-choiceroll
// Quick Launch, Impact Casing, Field Prep, Explosive Light
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 76 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4UoXFYD3DbunDEKIGDiriX?si=1957400d9e024ed5 with @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies, or burst damage against Major Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. If you're interested, a Semiotician is someone who studies semiotics - symbols and meanings think Tom Hanks' "Symbologist" character in the Da Vinci Code. While High Impact rocket launchers aren't optimum for damage - doing 10% less damage than adaptives and aggressives - this is still the best Strand RL cvailable as at season 21, with great stats at base. If you're using this against a boss, velocity is more impart and than blast radius, so Quick Launch is your best barrel perk choice, and Impact Casing in the mag adds a little extra damage it all helps!. For your boss damage roll, enhanced Field Prep as the first trait column support park boosts the reload speed but, more importantly, is the equivalent of two reserve mods so you only need one to get to the maximum of 10. Enhanced Explosive Light as the second column signature perk gives you 7 rockets with a 25% damage boost for the low, low costs of just picking up orbs - good for both burst and sustained damage. Whether you find the Head Rush origin trait useful will depend on how often you crouch and get up again - if you do, the additional handling and reload speed is useful, if not game-changing. Recommended MW: Reload Speed, with a damage-boosting Major, Boss or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-boss, pve-major, pve-god, pve-endgame, mkb, controller

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Majors and sustained damage against Bosses in end-game content. Shapeable. As at S21, A Distant Pull is the only non-raid kinetic rapid-fire sniper rifle. As you might expect, it comes with lower stats but it's still usable if you can fill the gaps. Fluted Barrel and Tactical Mag fill out Handling, Stability, Reload Speed and also max out the magazine size to 7. Overflow is laughably good on a special weapon, as a first trait column support park, doubling the magazine size just for picking up an ammo brick, even when stowed. Explosive Payload gives you a 30% passive damage boost, plus flinch, so is easily the best second column trait choice for your signature perk.

Backup PvE pick for burst damage against Majors in end-game content. Shapeable. Until Its Return has decent stats in comparison to other kinetic slot rapid-fire shotguns and some reliable trait combinations. You can essentially ignore stability, handling and reload speed with the right traits, so you're left with range choices for the barrel, but Tactical Mag gets you to the maximum of 8 rounds, so there's no point looking at Appended or Extended Mag. In the first trait column as the support perk, Threat Detector at two stacks maxes handling and reload speed, and increases stability to around 80 and Surrounded in the second column as the signature perk boosts damage by 40% +47% for the enhanced version. Alternatively, Trench Barrel boosts damage by 50% for three shots after a melee hit.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage to Majors in end-game content. Shapeable. Thin Precipice is the first Strand sword, and is the fan-favourite vortex spin-to-win frame to boot. As with all swords, Jagged Edge is the usual choice for the blade for its increased damage and Swordmaster's Guard to reduce the time it takes for your heavy attack to charge, although you might want to look at Burst Guard or Heavy Guard to help tank damage. Against a Major that's just about to stomp, bring up your block to us Flash Counter in the first trait column as the support park, to suppress and weaken them for 4s, and then you'll have a couple of seconds with a 50% damage bonus for your heavy spin attack, with Counterattack in the second column as the signature perk.

// The Supremacy PvE first-choice roll

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against majors in end-game activities. Shapeable. The Supremacy has decent in-band stats by comparison with other kinetic slot rapid-fire snipers. Putting out shots at pace needs some additional control with the barrel perk, but you also need handling if you're swapping between weapons, so Arrowhead Brake or Fluted Barrel are your best choices. Appended Mag gets you to the maximum of 7 in the mag without needing to use Extended Mag. As your first trait column support perk for burst damage, Enhanced Rewind Rounds refills 70% of the hits landed to the magazine from reserves when it's empty, or Lead from Gold is excellent for ammo economy. Bait and Switch as the second slot signature perk adds 35% dame when procced - excellent for burst damage against majors and champions when you don't want to waste power ammo, or if you're running Tractor Cannon and need a damage option. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against majors and sustained damage against bosses in end-game activities. Shapeable. Techeun Force however Saint Kabr pronounces it... is reprised in a new, highly desirable perk set. I say set, it's really just one perk in particular. The stats to start are pretty good, although the recoil direction needs some attention, so Arrowhead Brake will take that to a controllable 90. For a damage roll, Liquid Coils is the obvious choice - don't worry, we'll get around the charge time penalty later. In the first trait slot, as the support perk, Rewind Rounds means you should be able to keep shooting until the battery is empty - you need a minimum of two shots in the mag to proc it, but then it reloads 2 shots from reserves. Finally, as the signature perk in the second trait slot, the new-for-S21 Controlled Burst drops your charge time by 10% and increases damage by 20% just for hitting all your bolts, making this great for burst and sustained damage. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

// Hard Launch, Quick Launch, Impact Casing, Reconstruction, Demolitionist, Explosive Light
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 69 https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZIEMYfNzOu5TyLlLhU7hH?si=90ffff909a2e40f2 with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects - @ImpetusAlways is on holiday. Backup PvE pick for burst damage against majors and sustained damage against bosses in end-game activities. Shapeable. Apex Predator has gone from the insta-shard class when it dropped, to pretty much the best rocket launcher option for putting out damage. Even though the stats are only middling, and you can't get to 10 shots - the maximum is 9, with two reserve mods, it's already in the highest subfamily for damage along with Aggressives, and is the best craftable rocket launcher in the game, as at S21. For an unguided rocket, Velocity is usually the play for the barrel perk - Hard Launch and Quick Launch are the two best options, depending on whether you want better Velocity or a combination of Velocity and Handling. Impact Casing adds 2.2% multiplicative damage in the magazine perk slot. In the first trait column as the support perk, you can have a choice of Reconstruction to passively overfill the barrel with 2 shots, or Demolitionist for the instant reload when throwing a grenade and the extra damage from the grenade as well. Enhanced Explosive Light lets you shoot seven rockets with a 25% damage boost, just for picking up orbs. Recommended MW: Reload Speed, Velocity or Handling, with a damage-boosting Major, Boss or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-boss, pve-major, pve-god, pve-endgame, mkb, controller

Backup PvE pick for burst damage against majors and bosses with short damage windows in end-game activities. Shapeable. Apex Predator has gone from the insta-shard class when it dropped, to pretty much the best rocket launcher option for putting out damage. Even though the stats are only middling, and you can't get to 10 shots - the maximum is 9, with two reserve mods, it's already in the highest subfamily for damage along with Aggressives, and is the best craftable rocket launcher in the game, as at S21. For a guided rocket, you want to velocity as low as possible, to give the shot plenty of time for course correction if your target jinks, and Confined Launch is the barrel to do that. Impact Casing adds 2.2% multiplicative damage in the magazine perk slot. In the first trait column Tracking Module is very useful for hitting more mobile majors and bosses, while in the second slot as the signature perk, Enhanced Explosive Light lets you shoot seven rockets with a 25% damage boost, just for picking up orbs.

First thing to say, if you already have a rapid hit or lightweight Trench Barrel shotgun then just shard this. If you haven't, then Compass Rose can be your stopgap until you do. The stats are a bit of a mixed bag, but Handling is usually the play with shotguns anyway, so Corkscrew Rifling or Barrel Shroud improve that, as well as other useful gunfeel stats, and Assault Mag increases your rate of fire, and hence DPS, or Tactical Mag takes the mag size to six to let you get two full bursts of three shots off without reloading, and then helps with reload speed. Grave Robber can be useful, if you're near a crowd of minors to keep Trench Barrel procced, but if you're doing damage against a single target it's not much use, so Lead From Gold is more reliably useful.

It's difficult to know what role Precision rocket launchers are suppose to fill as at season 21. they do have the intrinsic tracking, but to 21% less damage than the adaptive and aggressive subfamilies, and can't ever compete with the blast radius of high-impacts for add clear. If you are going to use it, play into the tracking, and reduce the velocity so if an enemy jinks, it has as much time as possible to adjust with Confined Launch. Impact Casing adds some extra impact damage in the mag perk slot, or Alloy Casing provides faster reloads. Field Prep helps massively with ammo reserves - without it it you'll need three ammo reserve chest mods to get to 10 rockets, but with it you'll only need one. In the second trait column Envious Assassin can get you an extra shot in the mag with just one kill from another weapon, or if you can get to 11 rapid kills, you can load three, or you can use the small blast radius as a benefit to concentrate Cluster Bombs on your target for extra damage.

There are traits which bypass reload time and work best with as large a magazine as possible, so Ionized or Enhanced Battery are the top battery choices. In the first trait slot as the support perk, Overflow doubles your magazine size just for running over a special ammo brick, or 7-8 rapid kills with another weapon overfills the magazine by up to 10 shots with Envious Assassin. Every shot in your overfilled mag, beyond it's normal limit, can be used with Controlled Burst - hit all the bolts to get +20% to damage and 10% reduced charge time to burst down Majors and maybe for the occasional boss DPS phase.

// Taraxippos PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Fourth Time's The Charm, Explosive Payload
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 61 https://open.spotify.com/episode/35xKd0TwFvvOyymsE9Wp5H with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities. Named after a ghost that frightened horses at a particular spot on the Olympia race course during ancient games there. Our first Lightweight Strand scout rifle has only one direct kinetic slot competitor in Night Watch, and is pretty comparable in stats, although will do 10% less damage, as a non-kinetic weapon. For min-maxxers, the +30 Mobility from the intrinsic perk can help to flesh out builds. Taraxippos is fast-firing, so you will need to tidy up the 54 Recoil Direction. Arrowhead Brake in the barrel takes it to a manageable 84. In the magazine, Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell both offer useful boosts to stability and reload speed and an extra shot for Tac Mag. Fourth Time's The Charm in the first trait column as your support perk is always welcome to extend your mag size, while Explosive Payload in the second column as the signature perk adds 30% damage with no falloff, and is useful when Scouts are the seasonal anti-Overload Champion mod, only needing two shots to disrupt. The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful - who would say no to extra class ability energy? Or, Omolon Fluid Dynamics adds stability and reload speed to the top half of your mag. Recommended MW: Range, Stability or Handling - just go with your preference, with a damage-boosting Minor or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-champion, pve-god, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

First-choice PvE roll for burst damage against Majors in end-game content. While slug shotguns aren't the burst damage meta they once were, they can still deal decent damage when the occasion demands. For the barrel, stability is a bit more important than normal, to keep your reticule on target, but Handling is still useful too. Assault Mag increases RPM to 70 to increase your damage output. As your first trait column support perk, Reconstruction or Fourth Time's The Charm both work to extend the magazine during a damage window and, for your second column signature perk, take your choice of Frenzy, Vorpal Weapon or Focused Fury to boost damage output with. The Harmonic Resonance origin trait can boost damage still further by a stacking 3.33% with one other RoN Raid weapon or 10% with two. Recommended MW: Range, Stability or Handling - just go with your preference, with a damage-boosting Major or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod tags:pve, pve-boss, pve-major, pve-god, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

First-choice PvE roll for Majors in end-game content. Most Raid weapons boast stellar stat packages, and Acasia's Dejection is no different - this is the best legendary trace rifle as at v7.0.0.6.

// Acasia's Dejection Adept PvE first-choice roll
// Smallbore, Polygonal Rifling, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Enhanced Battery, Light Battery, Tactical Battery, Particle Repeater, Rewind Rounds, Reconstruction, Target Lock
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 57 https://open.spotify.com/episode/3LOWj7jLe0eiacDYwEbK22 with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE roll for Majors in end-game content. Most Raid weapons boast stellar stat packages, and Acasia's Dejection is no different - this is the best legendary trace rifle as at v7.0.0.6. The recoil is already pretty easy to control with 96 Recoil Direction and 80 stability, so your barrel and battery choices are more of a bonus than gap filler. For use against Majors, an overflowed or refilled magazine is a great place to start, so Reconstruction or Rewind Rounds as your first trait column support perk can both take advantage of the higher damage stacks of Target Lock as your second column signature perk, turning this into a legendary solar Coldheart. The Harmonic Resonance origin trait can boost damage still further by a stacking 3.33% with one other RoN Raid weapon or 10% with two. Recommended MW: Range, Stability or Handling - just go with your preference, with a damage-boosting Adept Big Ones or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod tags:pve, pve-boss, pve-major, pve-god, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

// Harsh Language PvE first-choice roll
// Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control, High-Velocity Rounds, Envious Assassin, Field Prep, Threat Detector, Stats for All, Golden Tricorn
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for void synergy and burst damage to Majors in end-game content. The reprised Harsh Language is only the second void wave-frame grenade launcher. Lower stats that Deafening Whisper although the range of stats is pretty compressed - the New Devrim Kay VIII Foundry Field Tested origin perk should help, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers. You start out with 100 blast radius - not that it makes any difference as it's the dump stat for wave frame GLs - so you can use the barrel and mag perks for velocity and handling. Quick Launch is ideal, and Smart Drift Control works as a good alternate, and out of the two choices, High-Velocity Rounds is the mag perk to choose. In the first trait column Envious Assassin can give you up to three shots in the barrel for killing adds with your primary or power weapon, but Field Prep, Threat Detector or Stats for All are all worth considering as a support perk. Void subclasses provide a great toolkit to trigger the second stack of Golden Tricorn for 50% bonus damage, in the second trait column for your signature perk. Recommended MW: Handling or Velocity, with a damage-boosting Major or Taken Spec mod tags:pve, pve-boss, pve-major, pve-god, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for sustained damage to Bosses and Majors in end-game content. The reprised Hand in Hand is the only non-endgame arc aggressive shotgun currently as at v7.0.0.6 in game but, as usual for a world drop, the stats are on the low side - the New Devrim Kay VIII Foundry Field Tested origin perk should help, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers. Building towards One-Two Punch as your signature perk, Full Choke aids pellet spread, as you'll need to hit your target with all of them. Then Tactical Mag adds an extra extra shot and a bonuses to reload speed and stability which admittedly, you'll not need so much. As your support perk in the first trait column, Slideshot is normally regarded as a PvP-flavoured perk but bypasses the reload to keep the magazine full for One-Two Punch in the second trait column.

Handling is the standard play for shotguns, so Barrel Shroud or Corkscrew Rifling are your best choices. Assault Mag brings your RPM up to 60 and also boosts stability - maybe not so essential with a slower firing shottie, but still nice. As your support perk in the first trait column, Slideshot is normally regarded as a PvP-flavoured perk but bypasses the reload to keep the magazine full, and you can take advantage of the arc toolkit to proc the second stack of Golden Tricorn as your signature perk in the second trait column to boost damage by 50%, as well as proccing useful arc verbs, like Blinding with Spark of Beacons.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for damage to Bosses in end-game content. First thing to say about the reprised Nasreddin named for a legendary trickster figure in Muslin folklore is that if you already have a decent arc sword, you can give this a miss, as there's nothing that really makes it stand out except, maybe, for a slightly higher base Impact stat, and the new Devrim Kay VIII Foundry origin trait which should make the heavy attack rechage rate a little faster, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers. For newer Guardians, the usual recommendations of Jagged Edge as the blade perk for additinal damage, Swordmaster's Guard for the guard perk to get the heavy attack up as fast as possible. Then Relentless Strikes as your support perk in the first trait column, which works well to return ammo against all enemies, and either Whirlwind Blade or Surrounded, to boost damage, for your signature perk in the second.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for Major and Boss damage in end-game content. Shapeable. The Hakke foundry for Season 20 is Marsilion-C named after the King of Muslim Spain in the late 700s CE, if you're asking, a rapid-fire, solar power grenade launcher with decent stats and which is very usable if you don't already have existing options. For major or boss damage, if you look build into Explosive Light as your signature perk in the second trait column then, as your blast radius is already set to 100, you can concentrate on Velocity in your Barrel - Quick Launch or Smart Drift Control and, even with 100 Blast Radius, Spike Grenades will still provide some extra impact damage as your mag perk. Envious Assassin overflows the magazine from primary and special weapon skills so you can take full advantage of the Enhanced Explosive Light's extra stack of damage over the standard version and have a magazine capable of using all seven stacks before reloading!

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. ??? ???: First-choice PvE roll for solar synergy and Minor add-clear in end-game content. Shapeable. The Hakke foundry for Season 20 is Marsilion-C named after the King of Muslim Spain in the late 700s CE, if you're asking, a rapid-fire, solar power grenade launcher with decent stats and which is very usable if you don't already have existing options. If you looking for a fun add-clear weapon for bulkier minors, with an eye towards Incandescent as your signature perk in the second trait slot, then maximise your Blast Radius with your barrel and mag perks, and masterwork - Volatile Launch or Confined Launch with High-Explosive Ordnance. Envious Assassin overflows the magazine from primary and special weapon kills, or Field Prep adds bonus reserves and reload speed as you options for your support park in the first trait column.

// Royal Executioner PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Accelerated Coils, Envious Assassin, Reservoir Burst
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 55 https://open.spotify.com/show/36OTFinErCUBrCzu6BaYbo with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for burst damage in end-game activities. Shapeable. Season 20's solar adaptive fusion rifle has okayish stats, with the Noble Deeds origin perk helping with a boost to handling and reload speed when procced. Arrowhead Brake as the barrel perk makes the recoil much easier to control, taking the Recoil Direction from 58 to 88. Particle Repeater is an option to control the bolts, but Accelerated Coils is the better play - you'll be killing red bars even with the slight reduction in damage and you'll appreciate the faster charge time. The Noble Deeds origin trait helps with Handling, for more snappiness and Reload Speed, so fits in really well. Envious Assassin is the stand out support perk in the first trait column - overflow the magazine with primary and power weapon kills, and this is the only non-Raid fusion rifle that you can do that with. Every overflowed shot will then do 25% bonus damage with Reservoir Burst as your second trait column, signature perk, as well as making enemies explode, making this great for both add-clearing groups of minors and burst damage against majors.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 55 https://open.spotify.com/show/36OTFinErCUBrCzu6BaYbo with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for Majors and Bosses in end-game content. Shapeable. This is maybe our first non-Raid sword with significantly different stats - the Charge Rate is 60, by comparison with every other adaptive sword's 20 except DSC's Bequest, and the Noble Deeds origin perk boosts the charge rate further for buffing Guardians around you. As with most swords, go for as much impact damage as possible, so Jagged Edge as your blade plus the inevitable Impact Masterwork. Swordmaster's Guard is a reliable guard perk to have your heavy attack available quickly. For your support park in the first trait column, Relentless Strikes don't require a kill to return ammo, so is best for chunkier adds and Majors, although Flash Counter's weaken effect is also worth considering. Majors are usually accompanied by minors, so Surrounded especially when enhanced or One for All as signature perks in the second trait column can both work well when you need to do damage up close.

The Ambush origin trait is probably more for PvP than PvE, with the extra range, handling and 10% boost to damage for a few moments after combat starts but will be more use for a glaive than Hakke Breach Armaments.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. First-choice PvE roll for general content. Shapeable. The Ambush origin trait is probably more for PvP than PvE, with the extra range, handling and 10% boost to damage for a few moments after combat starts, although Suros Synergy's flinch reduction in reload is useful in a firefight too so take your pick. This is better in every stat than the only other rapid fire LMG - Shattered Cypher - and there are a few ways you can go with a weapon build. You'll need to control your fire with short bursts - so, to make it easier, tighten up the recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake. For damage against a single target, you want your magazine as large as it will go, so look for Extended or Appended. Then extend the magazine with Fourth Time's the Charm, or improve your ammo reserves and reload with Field Prep in the first trait column to give Target Lock's 40& bonus to damage as much uptime as possible.

Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Enhanced Battery, Field Prep, Frenzy, Vorpal Weapon
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. First-choice PvE roll for end-game boss DPS. Shapeable. Veist Stinger is the origin trait to use, as it procs per shot rather than per burst, which means you'll probably never need to reload. F&F is a non-endgame obtainable  boss-killing replacement for Reed's Regret, and a aggressive-frame companion to Stormchaser. Being a stasis LFR, it's easy to get a Font of Might 25% boost to your damage if you have a Warlock putting down a Well and willing to use the Supreme Wellmaker mod, and you're using the Elemental Shards and Elemental Time Dilation mods. You'll need to keep your shots on a boss's crit spot, so maximise your stability with your barrel, and then add in an extra charge with no downsides with Enhanced Battery. For major or boss damage, use Field Prep to boost your ammo reserves which you'll be calling on with Veist Stinger.

// Fluted Barrel, Appended Mag, Clown Cartridge, Vorpal Weapon, High-Impact Reserves
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 37. PvE first-choice roll for burst damage against Majors. The Origin Trait, gaining better ADS and strafe speed when on your own, might be useful when you're away from your fireteam, but think of it more as a useful added extra when it's procced. Direct competitor to Occluded Finality, but with a much more reasonable 45 Zoom. You don't really need to worry about range, so look no further than Fluted Barrel to boost Handling and Stability. It's difficult to get to five in the mag to make Triple Tap proc twice, so go for Appended Mag instead to add an extra round. In the first trait column, Clown Cartridge boosts magazine size by a shot or two on reload, and in the second column, Vorpal Weapon adds 15% damage against Majors, Bosses and vehicles or High-Impact Reserves will add up to 25% bonus damage once you get past the second bullet. Recommended MW: Handling, with a damage-boosting Major or Taken Spec mod.

// Commemoration PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Chambered Compensator, Extended Barrel, Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Extended Mag, Subsistence, Killing Tally
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast Versus Enemies episode 48 with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for end-game activities. The Bray Inheritance trait is really useful for PvE, returning from 0.46% to 2% ability energy from hits the amount depends on the weapon archetype. Good stats and a stellar PvE perk pool make this an LMG worth chasing. You can choose to sort the recoil with Arrowhead Brake, Chambered Compensator or Extended Barrel, or improve stability with Fluted Barrel or Polygonal Rifling. Most mag choices could have a role - boost your magazine size with Tactical, Appended or Extended Mag. Killing Tally is the easiest to proc damage boosting perk if you're killing adds - 3 kills equals 30% bonus damage until you stow or reload, which you won't have to do much with Subsistence refreshing your magazine, so you could keep firing until you're empty. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Backup Mag, or damage-boosting Major, Boss or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-boss, pve-major, pve-god, controller, mkb

Use the barrel to round out your preferred Range/ Stability/ Handling stat, and then you want as many bullets in the mag as possible with Extended Mag using a trait to help with the reload penalty, to help with the origin trait boost. Then, to synergise with Solar subclasses, you can craft a mini-Sunshot by taking Ensemble for the faster reload and handling in a fireteam, together with Incandescent for your scorch and ignite explosion chaining.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for Stasis builds in end-game content. Shapeable. The Origin Perk is aimed at playing with a fireteam - the larger, the better your magazine size after reload will be. The only High-Impact Stasis LMG available as at v6.2.0.6, but comparing to other HIs, the stats are a mixed bunch. It's slow-firing, so you should be able to control the recoil with extra stability from the barrel choice. Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell are both good choices in the mag slot. Treat this as a heavy Scout Rifle for dealing with beefier adds and choose your traits accordingly - Stats For All or Heating Up add significant gunfeel boosts, or Unrelenting helps with health regeneration. For Stasis subclasses, Headstone provides a starting point for boosting abilities, crowd control or gaining damage reduction.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Shapeable. The Origin Perk is aimed at playing with a fireteam - the larger, the better your magazine size after reload will be. Decent in-slot stats compared to Exile's Curse or Wizened Rebuke. Generally, with fewer bolts being fired from a High-Impact frame, you don't have to worry so much about stability, so can either push the range or improve handling with your barrel. Increasing the battery size with Ionised Battery and Reservoir Burst pushes you to the maximum of 8 in the mag with Enhanced RB you only need Enhanced Battery. You can get around the reload penalty from Ionised Battery when crouching with Field Prep and have more ammo in reserve to use in combination with Reservoir Burst. With a battery size of eight, you'll get up to five overflowed shots with the origin trait if you're in a Raid near a full fireteam, or three reloading in a normal fireteam of three. RB procs on any overflowed charges from the origin trait, with a 25% damage bonus and those lovely explosions on kills maybe with Arc 3.0 Spark of Beacons for a bit of blinding too on them all.

// Midha's Reckoning Harrowed PvE first-choice roll
// Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Ionised Battery, Field Prep, Reservoir Burst
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Shapeable. The Origin Perk is aimed at playing with a fireteam - the larger, the better your magazine size after reload will be. Decent in-slot stats compared to Exile's Curse or Wizened Rebuke. Generally, with fewer bolts being fired from a High-Impact frame, you don't have to worry so much about stability, so can either push the range or improve handling with your barrel. Increasing the battery size with Ionised Battery and Reservoir Burst pushes you to the maximum of 8 in the mag. You can get around the reload penalty from Ionised Battery when crouching with Field Prep and have more ammo in reserve to use in combination with Reservoir Burst. With a battery size of eight, you'll get up to five overflowed shots with the origin trait if you're in a Raid near a full fireteam, or three reloading in a normal fireteam of three. RB procs on any overflowed charges from the origin trait, with a 25% damage bonus and those lovely explosions on kills maybe with Arc 3.0 Spark of Beacons for a bit of blinding too on them all. Recommended MW: Range or Handling, with a damage-boosting Adept Big Ones or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-god, pve-boss, pve-major, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 31. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. The Origin Perk works well in CQC, and in particular for melee-heavy playstyles, so that's not very useful for a Scout Rifle. Arrowhead Brake cleans up the recoil direction, and either Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell help with both stability and Reload Speed. For endgame, both Fourth Time's The Charm and Rapid Hit help keep the bullets coming, and Explosive Payload helps with damage, flinch and disrupting Overload Champions when the mods around.

// Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Assault Mag, Tactical Mag, Outlaw, Surrounded
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 31. PvE first-choice roll for general content. The Origin Perk works well in CQC, and in particular for melee-heavy playstyles. High-ish stats make this fairly competitive in slot if you don't look too closely at Heritage, anyway. You can never go wrong with a bit more range from your barrel, and faster fire rate, or an extra round in the mag and better reload speed. For endgame content, Outlaw keeps the bullets coming, and Surrounded provides a huge boost to CQC damage, complimenting the origin perk, and will help with damage against champions when the mod is in town.

// Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control, Blinding Grenades, Auto-Loading Holster, Danger Zone
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 26. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Another opportunity to get a kinetic Blinding Grenade Launcher, if you haven't already - an essential tool in any end-game toolbox. You'll be swapping back and forth, so go for a handling barrel. Obviously Blinding Grenades in the mag, and then Auto-Loading Holster to reload while you're mopping up your blinded enemies with your Energy weapon. There's not that much in the second column of traits, but Danger Zone give you additional damage options when you're in CQC.

// Wastelander M5 PvE first-choice roll
// Full Choke, Tactical Mag, Assault Mag, Pugilist, One-Two Punch
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 30. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. The first Tex Mechanica legendary weapon - a lightweight, so it boosts mobility for movement speed. To clear majors, use Full Choke to constrain the pellet spread a little, Tactical Mag for an extra bullet in the magazine or Assault Mag if you miss a pellet. Then, Pugilist and the Hot Swap origin perk help boost handling, and One-Two Punch adds a huge damage boost against majors and bosses.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 30. PvE first-choice roll for solar subclasses in general content. This was our first legendary Trace Rifle, and the S18 reissued version new lets you build into scorch and ignite. Use the barrel and battery to improve range, stability, reload speed or battery capacity.

// Fastdraw HCS, Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, 
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 25. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Very stiff competition in-slot from Fatebringer, Eyasluna and DFA, but there are a few trait combinations that help claim a spot in your Vault. Look to boost Handling and Stability with sight and mag, to help gunfeel or maybe add a bullet or two. For end-game content, Ensemble helps speed reloads and Timed Payload adds damage, helps with Overload stuns and can proc Explosive Wellmaker. Drops from the first Phalanx Echo encounter if you're looking to farm it.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 25. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Sidearms are a... brave choice of Primary for endgame content. Handling and Stability could both do with some help from sight and mag, or the Combat Effect mags are always useful.

// Vouchsafe PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Tactical Mag, Rapid Hit, Explosive Payload
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 23. PvE first-choice roll for endgame content and anti-Champion mods. Still worth looking at, even without an origin perk, for void burn activities. The Recoil Direction needs some love, so Arrowhead Brake is your top choice, and Tactical Mag gives an extra shot, stability and reload speed. For endgame and anti-Champion use particularly Overloads, Rapid Hit and Explosive Payload are your top choices.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 23. PvE first choice roll for general content. Still worth looking at, even without an origin perk, with the update 4.1.5 buff to pellet shotguns. For boss damage, Full Choke keeps pellets together. Assault Mag helps with a follow-up shot if you miss a pellet, or Tactical Mag, Appended or Extended Mag all give the same +1 to mag size. Slideshot gets you reloads on the fly, Field Prep helps with both inventory or reloads, or Lead From Gold saves you running a finder/scavenger perk. Surrounded and the Spec mod gives a 40% CQC damage boost in a crowd. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Surrounded Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-god, pve-endgame, pve-minor, pve-major, controller, mkb

// Sleepless PvE first-choice roll
// Linear Compensator, Black Powder, Auto-Loading Holster, Field Prep, Chain Reaction
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 23. PvE first choice roll for endgame content. Middle of the road for raw damage, but the largest blast radius of any subtype. Maximise the blast radius with barrel and mag, and then Field Prep helps with reloads and inventory or Auto-Loading Holster lets you put the launcher away to focus on other enemies. Chain Reaction can help clear beefier adds in a crowd with minors.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 23. PvE first choice roll for endgame content. Round out the stats with barrel and mag.

// Tyranny of Heaven PvE first-choice roll
// Elastic String, Compact Arrow Shaft, Archer's Tempo, Explosive Head
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 23. PvE first choice roll for endgame content. Although suffering by comparison with the Precision bow subtype, if you've got a good roll, it's maybe worth hanging onto in case they ever get a bit of love. Your aim is to maximise damage output by getting as many arrows into opponents as possible, so get the Reload and Draw Speed down as far as possible with your bowstring and arrow. Archer's Tempo helps further speed up your RPM and Explosive Head boosts damage, adds flinch and helps with anti-champion mods.

// Hard Launch, Quick Launch, Linear Compensator, Smart Drift Control, Impact Casing, Ambitious Assassin, Kill CLip
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 23. PvE first choice roll for endgame content. The highest damage subtype. Improve the Velocity with the barrel, and damage with Impact Casing. Then, if you can get a kill before you need burst damage against a major or champion, you can reload for two shots with +33% damage with the Ambitious Assassin and Kill Clip combination.

@title:Episode 106 - Pale Heart weapons
@description:Pale Heart DLC weapons with the Dealer's Choice origin trait

// No Hesitation First-choice PvE
// Smallbore, Polygonal Rifling, Corkscrew Rifling, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Physic, Circle of Life
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 106 from 18 June 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/0GYlriUxhFqNHGLqb84C1G?si=bb5a2c9b339d4c35 with @ImpetusAlways, @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies and fireteam support in end-game content, particularly with solar/prismatic fragments that boost healing. Shapeable. A new Support frame auto-rifle subtype that builds healing charges on enemy hits there's a semi-circle below the reticule that fills up which you can then hip fire at allies to heal them. Hitting six hipfire shots on an ally heals 12 health per hit, and starts x1 Restoration for 4s after 6 rapid hits. This also grants both Guardians a +10% "Support Frame boost" to damage for 5s, which stacks with every other damage buff source. No Hesitation is probably the strongest solar primary currently in the game, if you're in a fireteam. It's a bit weird to fire as it's not hitscan - but if you can get used to Osteo Striga's tracking shots, you'll do fine. First off, controller players might benefit from a bit of extra stability from the barrel and mag perks. The first and second trait column perks can double down on the frame intrinsic perks through Physic which grants x1 Restoration x2 when enhanced for 5s to both you and allies when procced, and Circle of Life which boosts damage on healing by an additional +25% for 10s +37.5% total for the first 5s with the Support Frame Boost for both you and the healed Guardian. The Dealer's Choice origin trait is nice to have who doesn't love more super energy? - with two or three Pale Heart weapons, you'll notice the difference! Recommended MW: Stability, with a Backup Mag mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies and fireteam support in end-game content. Shapeable. A new Support frame auto-rifle subtype that builds healing charges on enemy hits there's a semi-circle below the reticule that fills up which you can then hip fire at allies to heal them. Hitting six hipfire shots on an ally heals 12 health per hit, and starts x1 Restoration for 4s after 6 rapid hits. This also grants both Guardians a +10% "Support Frame boost" to damage for 5s, which stacks with every other damage buff source. No Hesitation is probably the strongest solar primary currently in the game, if you're in a fireteam. It's a bit weird to fire as it's not hitscan - but if you can get used to Osteo Striga's tracking shots, you'll do fine. First off, controller players might benefit from a bit of extra stability from the barrel and mag perks. Demolitionist is great in the first trait column, but for grenade energy and instant reloads on a grenade throw, while Desperate Measures is very easy to proc with intrinsic for +10, +20 or +30% damage +21, +32 or +43% when the frame intrinsic is also procced. The Dealer's Choice origin trait is nice to have who doesn't love more super energy? - with two or three Pale Heart weapons, you'll notice the difference!

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. There aren't many comparators for Bold Endings - the good news is that the base stats are great, but the bad news is that they're still not very good, with stability, handling and reload speed all low so, although it's hard-hitting, it feels a bit clunky. Use the barrel and magazine perks to fill in the gaps. To help further, you can quickly get to the maximum stacks of Rapid Hit as the first trait perk, and you have ways of getting to three stacks of Desperate Measures using Transcendent melee and grenade for up to +30% damage. The Dealer's Choice origin trait is nice to have who doesn't love more super energy? - with two or three Pale Heart weapons, you'll notice the difference!

// Embraced Identity First-choice PvE
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 106 from 18 June 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/0GYlriUxhFqNHGLqb84C1G?si=bb5a2c9b339d4c35 with @ImpetusAlways, @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against major and bosses in end-game content. Shapeable. If you already have a good backup DPS sniper then you can safely pass on Embraced Identity. Decent base stats so, as ever, handling is the stat to boost with the barrel perk. Tactical Mag plus a Backup Mag mod gets you to 6 shots, or Appended Mag + Backup Mag gets you to 7. In the first trait column, Rewind Rounds or Reconstruction are both excellent. In the second column, Precision Instrument or High Ground both boost damage via different proc mechanisms, depending on whether you have a big crit spot to aim for, or can get your feet at least one metre higher than the feet of what you're shooting at so, weirdly, you can have it procced and still be shooting up at a taller enemy's head.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained DPS against Bosses in end-game content. Shapeable. Pro Memoria - which means "for memory" in Latin, and is also the name for a formal note embodying the written record of a diplomatic discussion - is the first in a new aggressive frame LMG subtype. It's described as "high damage", so should be good in a few different roles but with high recoil, look to the barrel perk to provide help with control and a little extra handling. As the magazine perk, for sustained boss damage, you'll want a perk that increases mag size or possibly helps a little more with recoil control. For sustained damage, in the first trait perk column, choose between Reconstruction for an effortless overflowed mag or Envious Assassin for a potentially bigger overflowed mag that needs add kills. In the second column, Target Lock or Bait and Switch although the swap speed isn't great make the most of your bullets in a sustained boss DPS phase.

@title:Episode 103 - BRAVE weapons part 2 missing Shiny rolls
@description:Second six Season 23 BRAVE arsenal weapons with the Indomitability origin trait

// Midnight Coup Shiny PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Smallbore, Polygonal Rifling, Fluted Barrel, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Steady Rounds, Explosive Payload, Kinetic Tremors, One for All, Frenzy, Desperate Measures
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 103 from 7 May 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4QnASNlI9E2wArvSynJjVp?si=eb7298468d714686 with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Midnight Coup's stats are a bit of a mixed bag in what's a very competitive subfamily. The recoil pulls a little to the right so you can sort that with Arrowhead Brake, or boost the stability with the barrel perk. It's not often you get access to two damage boost traits that don't need a weapon kill to proc, so take advantage of Explosive Payload in the first column, and then Kinetic Tremors which is strong on hand cannons against majors and minors, One for All, Frenzy or Desperate Measures to help tear through adds. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade or melee energy according to your subclass type. Recommended MW: Stability or Handling, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

// Blast Furnace Shiny PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag, Kinetic Tremors, Frenzy, One For All, Desperate Measures
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 103 from 7 May 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4QnASNlI9E2wArvSynJjVp?si=eb7298468d714686 with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Blast Furnace reappears with great stats as a well-rounded example of what is a pretty rare subfamily of Aggressive Burst frame pulse rifles, with a choice of barrels rather than the original's sights. The Rasmussen sight is decent although you don't get any of the stat bonuses. The recoil is 65 at base, so vertical if a bit ragged - Handling is probably where to invest barrel park stats through Fluted Barrel or Arrowhead Brake. In the mag perk slot, Flared Magwell and Tactical Mag are both solid. It's not often you get the option of two damage traits - Kinetic Tremors takes 11 hits to proc - one less when enhanced - for AoE damage in the first column. In the second, you can't really go wrong with Frenzy, One For All or Desperate Measures for a more direct passive damage boost, that doesn't need a weapon kill. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade or melee energy according to your subclass type. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

// Luna's Howl Shiny PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Smallbore, Flared Magwell, Light Mag, Heal Clip, Incandescent
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 103 from 7 May 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4QnASNlI9E2wArvSynJjVp?si=eb7298468d714686 with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a solar subclass. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Luna's Howl was changed from a Precision to an Adaptive back in the day, so the stats do look weird in comparison to its peers - it's stable and easy to use, but might feel strange if you're used to traditional 140 HCs. Take a barrel perk that gives you a little bit of everything to round things out - Corkscrew, Smallbore or Fluted. For the mag perk, you want the reload as snappy as possible - Flared Magwell has the biggest boost, with Light Mag a close second. There's really only one trait perk combination to search for - Heal Clip hence the need for reload speed and Incandescent. Great anyway, but even better when synergising with solar fragments. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade or melee energy according to your subclass type. Recommended MW: Reload Speed, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

// Forbearance Shiny PvE first-choice roll
// Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control, Countermass, High-Velocity Rounds, Ambitious Assassin, Chain Reaction
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 103 from 7 May 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4QnASNlI9E2wArvSynJjVp?si=eb7298468d714686 with @CourtProjects, @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. If you already have a shaped Forbearance from Vow of the Disciple, you can move along. If not, it's the current best-in-subfamily for stats. The most popular roll of a barrel perk that boosts handling and velocity, with High-Velocity Rounds in the magazine paired with Ambitious Assassin and Chain Reaction has been the add-clearing wave-frame of choice for the last few seasons, and should still be good even after the planned CR nerf. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade or melee energy according to your subclass type.

As with most wave-frames, you're looking for a barrel perk that boosts handling and velocity, with High-Velocity Rounds in the magazine. For CQC survivability, Unrelenting paired with Chain Reaction will help keep your health topped up in a crowd of adds, and should still be good even after the planned CR nerf. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade or melee energy according to your subclass type.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained Boss Spec damage as part of a Bait and Switch weapon rotation in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The Mountaintop has great stats and, even though it's now a "Micro-missile" frame, still retains the +20 Mobility and +6.25% movement speed bonuses of a lightweight. To maximise damage, you need to minimise the Blast Radius - there's only one barrel perk that does that, so Hard Launch is the only god-roll option. In the magazine park slot, Implosion Rounds gives the highest damage but Spike Grenades is so close as to make little practical difference. For the trait perks, Auto-Loading Holster just works - reloading in your pocket while you're doing dame with your heavy. To boost damage, Recombination provides a huge 100% bonus damage on your first shot when fully procced, but if you're firing eight or more shots over the course of a longer damage phase, you'll get more bonus damage from Frenzy or Vorpal Weapon, which also needs no setting up.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained Boss damage in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Hammerhead has lots of competition in the void Adaptive-frame LMG subfamily.

You're best choice of barrel perk is something that helps with the low handling and, as a bigger magazine means more ammo from bricks, Appended or Extended are the mag perks for choice. As trait perks, Rewind Rounds delays your need to reload, so keeping you in a fight for longer while Killing Tally's persistent +30% damage for as long as you don't swap or reload is the standout damage perk. Or, alternatively, Surrounded will add +47% damage when enhanced after Last Shape.

Being a precision frame, you don't really need to worry about recoil direction, and as a scout rifle you don't need to think about range either - use the barrel and mag perks to boost handling or stability, and maybe a little reload speed instead. The BRAVE Hung Jury offers Kinetic Tremors in the first trait perk column, which you can pair with another damage perk in the second - Explosive Payload just works all the time, or One For All is +35% damage when procced. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade of melle energy according to your subclass type. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 102 from 23 April 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/5kuhrmYKBDwvLtzZJQmxiK?si=7f73118bec6743ac with @Saint_Kabr, @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects. Backup PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. This is the fourth iteration of Hung Jury SR4 Shiny, and it's as much of a stat monster as ever. Being a precision frame, you don't really need to worry about recoil direction, and as a scout rifle you don't need to think about range either - use the barrel and mag perks to boost handling or stability, and maybe a little reload speed instead. Only if you don't already have a well-rolled endgame scout rifle, you have a good choice of reload and damage trait perks in the first and second columns to choose from. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade of melle energy according to your subclass type. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

// Hung Jury SR4 Shiny PvE backup roll
// Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Corkscrew Rifling, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Appended Mag, Rewind Rounds, Precision Instrument
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 102 from 23 April 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/5kuhrmYKBDwvLtzZJQmxiK?si=7f73118bec6743ac with @Saint_Kabr, @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects. Backup PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. This is the fourth iteration of Hung Jury SR4 Shiny, and it's as much of a stat monster as ever. Being a precision frame, you don't really need to worry about recoil direction, and as a scout rifle you don't need to think about range either - use the barrel and mag perks to boost handling or stability, and maybe a little reload speed instead. Rewind Rounds does work well with Precision Instrument, if you can keep landing headshots - it's here as a roll, even if it's not the most reliable PvE damage boost. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade of melle energy according to your subclass type. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

// Hung Jury SR4 PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Corkscrew Rifling, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Appended Mag, Kinetic Tremors, Explosive Payload, One For All
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 102 from 23 April 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/5kuhrmYKBDwvLtzZJQmxiK?si=7f73118bec6743ac with @Saint_Kabr, @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects.

Being a precision frame, you don't really need to worry about recoil direction, and as a scout rifle you don't need to think about range either - use the barrel and mag perks to boost handling or stability, and maybe a little reload speed instead. The BRAVE Hung Jury offers Kinetic Tremors in the first trait perk column, which you can pair with another damage perk in the second - Explosive Payload just works all the time, or One For All is +35% damage when procced. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade of melle energy according to your subclass type.

// Hung Jury SR4 PvE backup roll
// Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Corkscrew Rifling, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Appended Mag, Rewind Rounds, Precision Instrument
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 102 from 23 April 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/5kuhrmYKBDwvLtzZJQmxiK?si=7f73118bec6743ac with @Saint_Kabr, @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects. Backup PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. This is the fourth iteration of Hung Jury SR4, and it's as much of a stat monster as ever. Being a precision frame, you don't really need to worry about recoil direction, and as a scout rifle you don't need to think about range either - use the barrel and mag perks to boost handling or stability, and maybe a little reload speed instead. Rewind Rounds does work well with Precision Instrument, if you can keep landing headshots - it's here as a roll, even if it's not the most reliable PvE damage boost. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade of melle energy according to your subclass type. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

// Elsie's Rifle Shiny PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Chambered Compensator, High-Caliber Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Flared Magwell, Repulsor Brace, Frenzy, Desperate Measures
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 102 from 23 April 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/5kuhrmYKBDwvLtzZJQmxiK?si=7f73118bec6743ac with @Saint_Kabr, @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly for void subclasses. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. A D1 blast from the past, Elsie's Rifle has great stats and the frame adds accuracy for firing when stationery or not moving much. A little extra recoil direction with the barrel perk will help controlling shots, and any of the combat effect rounds or Flared Magwell for reload speed and a touch of stability are the mag perk top choices. Probably more for void Gyrfalcon Hunters, with easy access to volatile rounds, Repulsor Brace gives you a high uptime on void overshields, while Frenzy or Desperate Measures are great damage boosting options. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade of melle energy according to your subclass type.

// Elsie's Rifle PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Chambered Compensator, High-Caliber Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Flared Magwell, Rewind Rounds, Frenzy, Desperate Measures
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 102 from 23 April 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/5kuhrmYKBDwvLtzZJQmxiK?si=7f73118bec6743ac with @Saint_Kabr, @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. A D1 blast from the past, Elsie's Rifle has great stats and the frame adds accuracy for firing when stationery or not moving much. A little extra recoil direction with the barrel perk will help controlling shots, and any of the combat effect rounds or Flared Magwell for reload speed and a touch of stability are the mag perk top choices. Rewind Rounds extends your magazine in the first trait column to pair with the 15% damage boost from Frenzy plus 100 Handling and Reload Speed or up to +30% damage from Desperate Measures. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade of melle energy according to your subclass type. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The Recluse is back and with even better range than the original. As a lightweight frame, you'll get the +20 mobility and +6.25% speed bonus to start. Add in a little extra stability in the barrel perk for easier control, and your preference of combat effect mag perk. For end-game add clearing, reload perks that don't need kills to proc, like Threat Detector or Enlightened Action would be your first choice, while Surrounded will be enhanceable in Final Shape for +47% damage. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade of melle energy according to your subclass type.

// The Recluse Shiny PvE backup roll
// Polygonal Rifling, Smallbore, Chambered Compensator, Corkscrew Rifling, High-Caliber Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Flared Magwell, Subsistence, Frenzy
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 102 from 23 April 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/5kuhrmYKBDwvLtzZJQmxiK?si=7f73118bec6743ac with @Saint_Kabr, @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects. Backup PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The Recluse is back and with even better range than the original. As a lightweight frame, you'll get the +20 mobility and +6.25% speed bonus to start. Add in a little extra stability in the barrel perk for easier control, and your preference of combat effect mag perk. If you never got a god-rolled Funnelweb, you can roll Subsistence and Frenzy on Recluse too. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade of melle energy according to your subclass type. Recommended MW: Stability, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The Recluse is back and with even better range than the original. As a lightweight frame, you'll get the +20 mobility and +6.25% speed bonus to start. Add in a little extra stability in the barrel perk for easier control, and your preference of combat effect mag perk. For end-game add clearing, reload perks that don't need kills to proc, like Threat Detector or Enlightened Action would be your first choice, while Surrounded will be enhanceable in Final Shape for +47% damage.

// The Recluse PvE backup roll
// Polygonal Rifling, Smallbore, Chambered Compensator, Corkscrew Rifling, High-Caliber Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Flared Magwell, Subsistence, Frenzy
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 102 from 23 April 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/5kuhrmYKBDwvLtzZJQmxiK?si=7f73118bec6743ac with @Saint_Kabr, @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects. Backup PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The Recluse is back and with even better range than the original. As a lightweight frame, you'll get the +20 mobility and +6.25% speed bonus to start. Add in a little extra stability in the barrel perk for easier control, and your preference of combat effect mag perk. If you never got a god-rolled Funnelweb, you can roll Subsistence and Frenzy on Recluse too. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade of melle energy according to your subclass type. Recommended MW: Stability, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The meme-machine is back and, although the stats are average, it's a beast for boss damage. Go for a barrel perk that boosts Velocity and Handling and then, unusually, Sticky Grenades is the top mag perk for this particularl roll bear with us. Either Field Prep or Cascade Point and Deconstruct together make this a great DPS choice. Either just take advantage of two extra reserve ammo and faster reload and handling from Field Prep, or proc Cascade Point with a couple of sniper crits and to proc the higher fire rate, while Deconstruct with Sticky Grenades pulls bonus ammo out of the air on every second, rather than every third, hit because of the delay before the explosive damage. This extends your effective magazine size to 11, but only using 6 ammo. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade of melle energy according to your subclass type.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a Stasis subclass. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The Slammer is our first vortex frame Stasis sword, with the same stats as its peers. Boost the damage with the blade perk, and then Swordmaster's Guard adds a little bit of everything useful. For add clearing, the trait perk combination, that's unique to The Slammer, of Chain Reaction and Cold Steel spreads slow stacks which you can improve with Stasis subclass fragments with the add kill explosions and, when enhanced, Cold Steel also adds a useful 10 to the inventory stat for additional ammo reserves. You'll probably find more use for the Vanguard's Vindication origin trait, unless there's a champion mod around for swords that works with Stunning Recovery.

// The Prophet PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Chambered Compensator, Polyconal Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Steady Rounds, Rapid Hit, Demolitionist, Keep Away, Explosive Payload, Precision Instrument
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 101 from 17 April 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/1CJQuqM89I7hWA9KYvjCop?si=arncPmZ1SseRp6Atuf1ilw with @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec add clearing in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The Prophet is the first stasis aggressive frame scout rifle and while it has good stats it's not a very competitive subtype for PvE unfortunately. It's got a bit of a kick so, even on M+KB you might benefit from boosted stability with the barrel and mag perks. The trait perks are a bit underwhelming too - Rapid Hit is probably best in the first column, with Demolitionist and possibly Keep Away also useful for the reload boost. In the second column, Explosive Payload is, again, probably best or Precision Instrument can be okay if you're hitting your headshots. Of the origin traits, Alacrity is best if you're running solo, in endgame activities to help clutch when everyone else is dead, or One Quiet Moment can be useful when in cover.

// The Prophet PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Chambered Compensator, Polyconal Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Steady Rounds, Rapid Hit, Demolitionist, Keep Away, Headstone
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 101 from 17 April 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/1CJQuqM89I7hWA9KYvjCop?si=arncPmZ1SseRp6Atuf1ilw with @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec add clearing in end-game content, particularly with a Stasis subclass. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The Prophet is the first stasis aggressive frame scout rifle and while it has good stats it's not a very competitive subtype for PvE unfortunately. It's got a bit of a kick so, even on M+KB you might benefit from boosted stability with the barrel and mag perks. The trait perks are a bit underwhelming too - Rapid Hit is probably best in the first column, with Demolitionist and possibly Keep Away also useful for the reload boost. In the second column, you should be able to create Stasis crystals easily enough, to synergise with the subclass fragments, but they'll be a long way away! Of the origin traits, Alacrity is best if you're running solo, in endgame activities to help clutch when everyone else is dead, or One Quiet Moment can be useful when in cover. Recommended MW: Stability, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

// The Prophet Adept PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Chambered Compensator, Polyconal Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Steady Rounds, Rapid Hit, Demolitionist, Keep Away, Headstone
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 101 from 17 April 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/1CJQuqM89I7hWA9KYvjCop?si=arncPmZ1SseRp6Atuf1ilw with @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec add clearing in end-game content, particularly with a Stasis subclass. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The Prophet is the first stasis aggressive frame scout rifle and while it has good stats it's not a very competitive subtype for PvE unfortunately. It's got a bit of a kick so, even on M+KB you might benefit from boosted stability with the barrel and mag perks. The trait perks are a bit underwhelming too - Rapid Hit is probably best in the first column, with Demolitionist and possibly Keep Away also useful for the reload boost. In the second column, you should be able to create Stasis crystals easily enough, to synergise with the subclass fragments, but they'll be a long way away! Of the origin traits, Alacrity is best if you're running solo, in endgame activities to help clutch when everyone else is dead, or One Quiet Moment can be useful when in cover. Recommended MW: Stability, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 101 from 17 April 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/1CJQuqM89I7hWA9KYvjCop?si=arncPmZ1SseRp6Atuf1ilw with @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content, particularly with a Solar subclass. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Summoner returns with great stats and an interesting PvE perk pool. The recoil could do with a little taming, so you can use barrel and mag perks to help, or go with the combat effect magansine of your choice. For the trait perks, Heal Clip and Incandescent can both be improved by solar subclass fragments, but even without them will cure 120 health for you and 60 for Guardians around you for reloading after a kill, and Incandescent spreads scorch and ignites enemies.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content, particularly with a Solar subclass. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Summoner returns with great stats and an interesting PvE perk pool. The recoil could do with a little taming, so you can use barrel and mag perks to help, or go with the combat effect magansine of your choice. For the trait perks, Heal Clip can be improved by solar subclass fragments, but even without them will cure 120 health for you and 60 for Guardians around you for reloading after a kill. Then Onslaught is loads of fun - but you'll need as much stability as you can to control things at three stacks. Of the origin traits, Alacrity is best if you're running solo, in endgame activities to help clutch when everyone else is dead but honestly, Wild Card is much more fun.

// The Summoner Adept PvE first-choice roll
// Chambered Compensator, Arrohead Brake, Polyconal Rifling, Smallbore. Corkscrew Rifling, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Flared Magwell, Perpetual Motion, Onslaught, Golden Tricorn, Target Lock
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 101 from 17 April 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/1CJQuqM89I7hWA9KYvjCop?si=arncPmZ1SseRp6Atuf1ilw with @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Summoner returns with great stats and an interesting PvE perk pool. The recoil could do with a little taming, so you can use barrel and mag perks to help, or go with the combat effect magansine of your choice. For the trait perks, Perpetual Motion is just a useful all-around boost to gunfeel to pair with a second column damage perk like Onslaught the extra stability is hand to control the recoil at three stacks, Golden Tricorn or Target Lock. Of the origin traits, Alacrity is best if you're running solo, in endgame activities to help clutch when everyone else is dead but honestly, Wild Card is much more fun. Recommended MW: Stability, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 101 from 17 April 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/1CJQuqM89I7hWA9KYvjCop?si=arncPmZ1SseRp6Atuf1ilw with @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. MultiMach CCX has the lightweight frame's +20 Mobility and +6.25% speed bonus, and the stats are great - it's just a shame there's nothing here to get excited about for PvE. If you must really?, look for stability to help with keeping shots on target and then - are you absolutely insisting still? - Attrition Orbs or Under Over in the first trait perk column, and Frenzy with Kinetic Tremors in a distant second. Of the origin traits, Field Tested provides solid escalating gunfeel boosts for landing hits, as long as you don't die. Recommended MW: Stability, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Tusk of the Boar is the first wave frame grenade launcher, with decent stats in comparison to its energy-slot peers. Generally, you'll want to increase velocity and add a bit of handling if you can with the barrel and mag perks. Use the first trait perk to bypass or improve the reload - Slideways is best, but Grave Robber or Enlightened Action can work too. Chain Reaction is the go-to second trait perk for additional explosive AoE damage on kills, to speed add clearing. Of the origin traits, Field Tested provides solid escalating gunfeel boosts for landing hits, as long as you don't die.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with Hunters on Strand subclasses. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Tusk of the Boar is the first wave frame grenade launcher, with decent stats in comparison to its energy-slot peers. Generally, you'll want to increase velocity and add a bit of handling if you can with the barrel and mag perks. In the first trait column Slice is very useful against harder-hitting enemies to sever them and reduce their damage output - it's easiest to proc with the Hunter dodge and can be improved with Thread of Continuity. Chain Reaction is the go-to second trait perk for additional explosive AoE damage on kills, to speed add clearing and spread sever over a wider area. Of the origin traits, Field Tested provides solid escalating gunfeel boosts for landing hits, as long as you don't die.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 97 from 13 March 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4Uy7pfo5Thjtt2MF4vZitv?si=8e3adcb68d234006 with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Adjudicator has decent stats and, with a precision frame, you don't need to worry too much about the published Recoil Direction. A little extra stability helps keep bullets on target, and a little extra range is nice, so Smallbore or Corkscrew Rifling can help out, or Chambered Compensator can take Recoil Direction to 100 as well as adding stability, You'll be emptying the mag a lot, so reload speed is the magazine perk choice - Alloy Mag, Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell all help. In the first trait column as the support park, Feeding Frenzy, Threat Detector and Subsistence all speed up reload as well as bumping up other useful stats, or delay the need to reload. With Frenzy procced in the second perk column, you'll have a 15% damage boost, snappy handling and lightning fast reloads. The Crossing Over origin trait is useful all around for PvE, with bumps to range and handling in the top half of a magazine, and a small 3% damage boost at the bottom - Subsistence kills keeps feeding ammo into the bottom half of the mag to extend the time the extra damage is procced. Recommended MW: Stability or Reload Speed, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. The Crossing Over origin trait is useful all around for PvE, with bumps to range and handling in the top half of a magazine, and a small 3% damage boost at the bottom. Prosecutor has decent stats by comparison to its peers and as it's a precision frame, you should find it fairly easy to control despite the 69 recoil direction. With that being the case, you can push out the range with the barrel perk, and any of the combat effect rounds as a mag perk will add a little more - High-Cal rounds in particular will help stun your minor adds. Rewind Rounds is a cunning plan to take advantage of the origin trait's bottom of the mag damage boost by continually refreshing the bottom half of the mag, while Frenzy adds a reliable 15% damage boost and maxes out your handling and reload speed.

// Judgment PvE first-choice roll
// Fastdraw HCS, Steadyhand HCS, Truesight HCS, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Alloy Mag, Headstone, Timed Payload, Adrenaline Junkie
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 97 from 13 March 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4Uy7pfo5Thjtt2MF4vZitv?si=8e3adcb68d234006 with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a Stasis subclass. Judgment is back in a new Stasis form, although the stats are showing its age. On the plus side, you do still have Sight perks rather than barrels to choose from - Fastdraw, Steadyhand and Truesight all help to round out stats nicely. You can help reload speed with the mag perk - Tactical Mag is the top pick, but Flared Magwell or even Alloy Mag can work too. It's very unusual to see Headstone in the first trait perk slot, creating crystals to synergise with the Stasis fragments. Timed Payload looks interesting, although splitting impact and explosive damage might not play well with Headstone. Alternatively Adrenaline Junkie, when procced, will mean any Headstone crystals you create will share the same damage buffs when shattered. The Crossing Over origin trait is useful all around for PvE, with bumps to range and handling in the top half of a magazine, and a small 3% damage boost at the bottom.

// Relentless PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Extended Barrel, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Full Bore, Armor Piercing Rounds, High Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Slice, Feenzy
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 97 from 13 March 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4Uy7pfo5Thjtt2MF4vZitv?si=8e3adcb68d234006 with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a Strand subclass. Relentless returns as a Strand pulse rifle with below average stats that reveal its Season 1 origin. The recoil direction of 65 is vertical, if a little loose, so you either look to improve it further or, if you can handle the recoil, push out the range with your barrel perk. Any of the combat effect mag perks add further range in addition to the bullet behaviour. You don't need to run a strand subclass but if you do then Slice as the first trait perk can sever enemies to reduce their damage output very useful in a boss fight to help your fireteam, to synergise with Thread of Continuity. As the second trait perk, Frenzy provides a reliable passive 15% damage boost and maximises handling and reload speed stats. The Crossing Over origin trait is useful all around for PvE, with bumps to range and handling in the top half of a magazine, and a small 3% damage boost at the bottom.

// Darkest Before PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Armor Piercing Rounds, High Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Flared Magwell, Light Mag, Heal Clip, Subsistence, One For All
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 97 from 13 March 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4Uy7pfo5Thjtt2MF4vZitv?si=8e3adcb68d234006 with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a Solar subclass. Darkest Before is back in a solar, rather than arc configuration, with the same strong stat package as before. The recoil direction of 64 is pretty controllable, but if you want to make it even more reliable, Arrowhead Brake will take it to 94. If you're happy with the recoil, there's no harm in pushing out the range with your barrel perk instead. Any of the combat effect mag perks add further range in addition to the bullet behaviour, or Light Mag and Flared Magwell improve reload speed. Looking at One For All as the second trait perk, you can use the 35% damage boost to mow through enemies while, as the first trait perk, you either Cure yourself and your fireteam with Heal Clip, or automatically top up your magazine with Subsistence. The Crossing Over origin trait is useful all around for PvE, with bumps to range and handling in the top half of a magazine, and a small 3% damage boost at the bottom.

@title:Reprised and new Guardian Games 2024 weapons
@description:Season 23 refreshed Guardian Games weapons with Classy Contender origin trait

// Taraxippos PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling, Polygonal Rifling, Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Extended May, Alloy Mag, Flared Magwell, Fourth Time's The Charm, Explosive Payload
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 98 from 19 March 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/0cxvW6vTZVWtwmXkqr7g1f?si=66932432408046d2 with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Named after a ghost that frightened horses at a particular spot on the Olympia race course during ancient games there. Still the only Lightweight Strand scout rifle with pretty solid stats. For min-maxxers, the +20 Mobility from the intrinsic perk and +6.25% movement speed can help to flesh out builds. Taraxippos is fast-firing, so you will need to control the recoil, as well as flesh out the stats with the barrel perk. For the magazine perk, you're looking to reduce reload speed, or boost magazine size or a bit of everything with Tactical Mag. Fourth Time's The Charm in the first trait column as your support perk is always welcome to extend your mag size, while Explosive Payload in the second column as the signature perk passively boosts PvE damage. The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful - who would say no to extra class ability energy? Or, Omolon Fluid Dynamics adds stability and reload speed to the top half of your mag. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

// Taraxippos PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling, Polygonal Rifling, Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Alloy Mag, Flared Magwell, Gutshot Straight, Explosive Payload
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 98 from 19 March 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/0cxvW6vTZVWtwmXkqr7g1f?si=66932432408046d2 with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a Strand subclass. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Named after a ghost that frightened horses at a particular spot on the Olympia race course during ancient games there. Still the only Lightweight Strand scout rifle with pretty solid stats. For min-maxxers, the +20 Mobility from the intrinsic perk and +6.25% movement speed can help to flesh out builds. Taraxippos is fast-firing, so you will need to control the recoil, as well as flesh out the stats with the barrel perk. For the magazine perk, you're looking to reduce reload speed, or boost magazine size or a bit of everything with Tactical Mag. If you get the combination of Gutshot Straight and Explosive Payload in the first and second trait columns, it might be worth hanging on to as there's a weird interaction that passively boosts body shot damage by +38% and crit damage by 16%. The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful - who would say no to extra class ability energy? Or, Omolon Fluid Dynamics adds stability and reload speed to the top half of your mag. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

// The Title PvE first-choice roll
// Corkscrew Rifling, Smallbore, Fluid Barrel Polygonal Rifling, High-Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Alloy Mag, Flared Magwell, Threat Detector, Perpetual Motion, Collective Action, Surrounded
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 98 from 19 March 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/0cxvW6vTZVWtwmXkqr7g1f?si=66932432408046d2 with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The Title has decent stats in a crowded and competitive subfamily, including vertical recoil of 85 and 15 zoom, where 14 is the norm. Use the barrel perk to boost handling and/or stability, and the the combat effect magazine perks all have a place, or just look to boost reload speed with Alloy Mag or Flared Magwell. If you're looking for a workhorse void SMG, Threat Detector or Perpetual Motion in the first trait column to round out stats and boost reload, combined with Collective Action or Surrounded in the second for a solid damage boost will serve you well. The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful - who would say no to extra class ability energy? Hakke Breach Armaments adds damage to vehicles and constructs, but that's probably not as useful here.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly for melee builds. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The Title has decent stats in a crowded and competitive subfamily, including vertical recoil of 85 and 15 zoom, where 14 is the norm. Use the barrel perk to boost handling and/or stability, and the the combat effect magazine perks all have a place, or just look to boost reload speed with Alloy Mag or Flared Magwell. If you're building around a melee gamestyle, in the first trait column you should be looking at Pugilist or Grave Robber to pair with Swashbuckler in the second. The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful - who would say no to extra class ability energy? Hakke Breach Armaments adds damage to vehicles and constructs, but that's probably not as useful here.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly for Gyrfalcon Hunters. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The Title has decent stats in a crowded and competitive subfamily, including vertical recoil of 85 and 15 zoom, where 14 is the norm. Use the barrel perk to boost handling and/or stability, and the the combat effect magazine perks all have a place, or just look to boost reload speed with Alloy Mag or Flared Magwell. Gyrfalcon void Hunters can already apply volatile rounds at will so kills to proc Repulsor Brace in the first trait column will be easy - but be aware this overrides the Void reserve Shield so you don't get the boost to class ability regeneration - but you do get the origin trait boost instead. In CQC you'll probably find the Overshield damage reduction really useful anyway, especially when paired with void fragments like Echo of Persistence. With the second column, as you don't need Destabilizing Rounds, Surrounded is a great passive boost to damage - up to 47% when you're able to enhance the perk. The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful in the play loop to get your dodge back faster - Hakke Breach Armaments adds damage to vehicles and constructs, but that's probably not as useful here.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Only the second heavy wave-frame GL, so there's not a big pool to compare against, but it's noticeable that Hullabaloo has lower inventory stat than Dimensional Hypotrochoid, so you can't carry a many reserves and don't get as many shots per heavy brick. There's not much to tinker with stats-wise with the barrel and mag perks - we're looking for velocity, handling and reload speed. Field Prep in the first trait column makes up somewhat for the inventory stat, and when it's enhanced it's only one shot away from max ammo, without the need for any reserve mods one would get you to the max. Chain Reaction in the second column makes this your heavy Forbearance for crowd control - you should be able to wipe out add-dense areas or spawns in end-game activities. The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful - who would say no to extra class ability energy?

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with arc subclasses. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Only the second heavy wave-frame GL, so there's not a big pool to compare against, but it's noticeable that Hullabaloo has lower inventory stat than Dimensional Hypotrochoid, so you can't carry a many reserves and don't get as many shots per heavy brick - you'll likely need to run some ammo reserve mods. There's not much to tinker with stats-wise with the barrel and mag perks - we're looking for reload speed, velocity, and handling. For a little arc synergy, but mostly for the extra jolt lethality, Voltshot is a very fun option for the first trait column, working with Sparks of Ions and Discharge from the arc kit. Chain Reaction in the second column makes this your heavy Forbearance for crowd control - with the two traits in combination, you should be able to wipe out add-dense areas or spawns of even beefy enemies in end-game activities.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 934 https://open.spotify.com/episode/0M24D3moUjRCXj0AtIsCCx?si=208c6d31bdb7453e with @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor spec enemies in end-game content. Marcato-45 stars off with decent stats in comparison to its peers - although it has a small magazine, it compensates by having fairly hefty reserves. You'll need to keep the reticule on target, so choose a barrel perk that improves recoil direction or stability. Reload speed and mag size will also be important, so this is what to look for with the magazine perk choice. In the first trait column, Threat Detector, Triple Tap and Demolitionist are all good for either speeding up reloads or extending your magazine, while Onslaught will mow through minor adds, and be good for occasional burst damage against majors too.

// Marcato-45 PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Smallbore, Polygonal Rifling, Extended Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Alloy Mag, Slice, Hatchling
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 934 https://open.spotify.com/episode/0M24D3moUjRCXj0AtIsCCx?si=208c6d31bdb7453e with @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor spec enemies in general content, particularly with a Strand subclass. Marcato-45 stars off with decent stats in comparison to its peers - although it has a small magazine, it compensates by having fairly hefty reserves. You'll need to keep the reticule on target, so choose a barrel perk that improves recoil direction or stability. Reload speed and mag size will also be important, so this is what to look for with the magazine perk choice. Combine Slice, in the first trait column, to reduce damage output by 40% from bulkier adds with Hatchling for additional crowd control, and throw in supportive fragments to augment both, and this could be a fun add-suppressing and add-clearing roll. Recommended MW: Reload Speed, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

// Undercurrent PvE first-choice roll
// Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control, Hard Launch, Linear Compensator, High-Velocity Rounds, Ambitious Assassin, Voltshot
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 93 https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uYGSQqlyX1faCyATCDuno?si=IMSCRgTRQr-_THJdjxFMIQ with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with an arc subclass. Undercurrent is a decent choice for an arc wave-frame grenade launcher if you don't have access to a Forbearance or maybe even in addition to. The stats are worse - but it's not an end-game weapon so that's to be expected. Blast Radius has no meaningful effect, so maximise velocity, and try to help handling with the barrel perk. High-Velocity Rounds as the mag perk also usefully helps reload speed a bit too. For the first trait perk, Ambitious Assassin sets you up with two in the chamber physics be damned after a kill. With Voltshot as the second trait perk, you can alternate between an add-clearing shot to proc it, and then applying Jolt for crowd control or DoT against a beefier target. It requires the kill to set up, but Voltshot has a wider range of effect than Chain Reaction, so is probably worth a try, especially if you're running an arc subclass and add Sparks of Beacons, Ions and Discharge into the mix.

// Double-Edged Answer PvE first-choice roll
// Jagged Edge, Honed Edge, Tempered Edge, Swordmaster's Guard, Relentless Strikes, Whirlwind Blade, Surrounded
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 93 https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uYGSQqlyX1faCyATCDuno?si=IMSCRgTRQr-_THJdjxFMIQ with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss spec enemies in end-game content. Double-Edged Answer has awful base stats and a huge perk pool so, if you are looking for a roll, reset your Vanguard reputation a few times first. This shouldn't be your chase weapon but, if you need a waepon for boss damage, then Jagged Edge provides the most damage as a Blade perk, but decimates your ammo, so Honed Edge and Tempered Edge might be attractive alternatives, and Swordmaster's Guard provides a little bit of everything as the guard perk. For reliable boss damage, if you haven't got anything better, Relentless Strikes in the first trait column as the support perk refunds ammo after three hits, while either Whirlwind Blade provides an escalating 3% damage per hit topping off at +30% or, if you know there are other minor adds about, Surrounded boosts damage by a hefty 40%. Nadir Focus could be an interesting mini-Eager Edge - each light attack increases lunge distance, if you want some fun. Recommended MW: Impact, with a damage boosting Major or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-boss, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 93 https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uYGSQqlyX1faCyATCDuno?si=IMSCRgTRQr-_THJdjxFMIQ with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor spec enemies in end-game content. Double-Edged Answer has awful base stats and a huge perk pool so, if you are looking for a roll, reset your Vanguard reputation a few times first. This shouldn't be your chase weapon but, if you don't have a sword that's rolled for add clear, increase the ammo you're carrying even at the cost of impact - Minor adds will die anyway with your blade perk. Swordmaster's Guard provides an all-round boost to stats in the guard slot. For your support perk in the first trait slot, you could boost ammo reserves with Tireless Blade or Relentless Strikes, or regenerate health with Unrelenting. For your signature perk in the second trait slot. Surrounded or One For All both boost damage, in case you come up against something a bit bulkier. Nadir Focus could be an interesting mini-Eager Edge - each light attack increases lunge distance, if you want some fun, or just take the little bits of health from Vanuard's Vindication.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 93 https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uYGSQqlyX1faCyATCDuno?si=IMSCRgTRQr-_THJdjxFMIQ with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a void subclass. Double-Edged Answer has awful base stats and a huge perk pool so, if you are looking for a roll, reset your Vanguard reputation a few times first. This shouldn't be your chase weapon but, if you don't have a sword that's rolled for add clear, increase the ammo you're carrying even at the cost of impact - Minor adds will die anyway with your blade perk. Swordmaster's Guard provides an all-round boost to stats in the guard slot. For your support perk in the first trait slot, Repulsor Brace will provide a very handy void overshield when procced, while in the second, you can either take advantage of void abilities and use Surrounded in CQC or Destabilizing Rounds to apply a cloud of volatility. Either way, subclass fragments like Echo of Persistence, can build into subclass verbs. Nadir Focus could be an interesting mini-Eager Edge - each light attack increases lunge distance, if you want some fun, or just take the little bits of health from Vanuard's Vindication. Recommended MW: Impact, with a damage boosting Major or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-boss, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

// Retrofuturist PvE first-choice roll
// Barrel Shroud, Corkscrew Rifling, Smallbore, Assault Mag, Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Light Mag, Unrelenting, Frenzy
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 93 https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uYGSQqlyX1faCyATCDuno?si=IMSCRgTRQr-_THJdjxFMIQ with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing beefier Minor spec enemies in general content. Unfortunately, Retrofuturist is distinctly meh, so it's only worth hanging onto a roll if it fills a hole in your vault, and even then you'll have to reset your Crucible rank a few times to stand a decent chance of the roll you're after. As a Lightweight shotgun, you do get the +20 mobility and +6.25% movement speed and, for some reason, it has a base mags size of 7, but that's where the praise ends. If you're hanging onto one, try a barrel perk that adds Handling, although a bit of range and stability doesn't hurt either. Assault Mag and Tactical Mag are the best mag perk choices, but Appended Mag or Light Mag aren't bad. If you're planning to wade into groups of adds, them the trait combination of Unrelenting and Frenzy should keep you alive and killing for as long as you have ammo.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing beefier Minor spec enemies in general content. Incisor may be the chase playlist activity weapon for S23, being the first legendary strand trace rifle - possibly worth the pain of Trials for! Excellent stats plus the Alacrity origin trait for solo play start us off. Recoil Direction is 94, so you don't need to worry too much. Handling and stability are both useful in a barrel perk.

For an add clearing weapon, pair Subsistence in the first trait column as the support perk and Killing Tally ini the second as the signature perk. You'll get an untimed +30% damage bonus after three kills, with those kills partially refilling the magazine. This works well for a Warlock running Cenotaph Mask to drop heavy ammo for a fireteam.

// Breakneck PvE first-choice roll
// Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Extended Mag, Appended Mag, Subsistence, Enlightened Action, Kinetic Tremors
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 93 https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uYGSQqlyX1faCyATCDuno?si=IMSCRgTRQr-_THJdjxFMIQ with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor spec enemies in end-game content. Breakneck is back, and has very solid stats, although it looks like we're never going to see the OG and OP Rampage/ Onslaught version again, As a precision frame AR, you don't need to worry about recoil direction, so if you're considering an alternative roll bumps to any combination of the stats should feel good in choosing barrel perk options. Any of the combat effect magazines add utility and then, in the first trait column, you can choose between Subsistence to keep your magazine topped off and Enlightened Action for better handling and reload speed. In the second column, Kinetic Tremors helps with crowd control around a target. Recommended MW: Handling, Stability or Range, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

@title:Season 23 Seasonal weapons
@description:Season of the Wish seasonal weapons, with the Dragon's Vengeance origin trait 

// Appetence PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Chambered Compensator, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling, Ionized Battery, Overflow, Killing Tally
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 92 https://open.spotify.com/episode/2qpoxXfXzBXohHBrdQnHbd?si=aH9jqq3kRwOtwQoh2YhHDA with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. Appetence which means "a natural craving, desire or affinity", seeing as you're asking is the first legendary Stasis trace rifle. It has decent stats, and some interesting trait combinations. Take your pick of handling and/or stability and maybe a touch of recoil direction, if you need it to be a perfect 100, for the barrel perk. With an eye on Overflow as the support perk in the first trait column, Ionized Battery maximises the battery size. Enhanced Overflow gives you 229 in the battery, and 476 total ammo so 247 in reserve with no Reserve mods, up to 606 with three. Killing Tally is the best of the damage perks here, providing a 30% non-timed damage boost as long as you don't swap weapons. With Overflow topping up the battery, for just picking up an ammo brick, this could mean a pretty-much permanent bonus damage. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red or an ally dies. You'll get a reload and 11s of a boost to range and either charge rate or handling. Recommended MW: Stability or Handling, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

// Scatter Signal PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel, Enhanced Battery, Overflow, Controlled Burst
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 92 https://open.spotify.com/episode/2qpoxXfXzBXohHBrdQnHbd?si=aH9jqq3kRwOtwQoh2YhHDA with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major spec enemies, or fallback damage against Boss spec in end-game content. Shapeable. Scatter Signal is perhaps one of the best weapons for burst damage as at v7.3.0.5 - great all-round stats as well as offering excellent trait combinations. Controlling recoil, with nine bolts, is important, as is snappiness - Arrowhead Brake helps tidy up recoil direction, but you might consider Fluted Barrel for the combination of handling and stability instead. Enhanced Battery gives the same number of charges 8 as Ionized so, with one eye on Overflow, maximises the battery size. Enhanced Overflow will take your battery to 18 charges - you'll have one left in reserve. Adding two Reserve mods takes this to three reserve shots, and with Overflow topping up the battery, for just picking up an ammo brick, you might never need to reload. Controlled Burst reduces charge time to 414 and boosts damage by 20% for hitting all your bolts. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red or an ally dies. You'll get a reload and 11s of a boost to range and either charge rate or handling.

First-choice PvE pick for fallback damage against Boss spec in end-game content, particularly with a Strand subclass. Shapeable. Scatter Signal is perhaps one of the best weapons for burst damage as at v7.3.0.5 - great all-round stats as well as offering excellent trait combinations. Controlling recoil, with nine bolts, is important, as is snappiness - Arrowhead Brake helps tidy up recoil direction, but you might consider Fluted Barrel for the combination of handling and stability instead. Enhanced Battery gives the same number of charges 8 as Ionized, without any reload penalty. Slice, as the first trait column perk, when procced after using your class ability reduces outgoing damage from a target by 40% for 8s - increased by 50% with the Thread of Continuity fragment, whether or not they're immune - very useful in boss fights or as part of a Bait and Switch weapon rotation. Controlled Burst as the second trait perk reduces charge time to 414 and boosts damage by 20% for hitting all your bolts. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red or an ally dies. You'll get a reload and 11s of a boost to range and either charge rate or handling.

// Supercluster PvE first-choice roll
// Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Assault Mag, Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Slice, Surrounded, Vorpal Weapon
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 92 https://open.spotify.com/episode/2qpoxXfXzBXohHBrdQnHbd?si=aH9jqq3kRwOtwQoh2YhHDA with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for fallback damage against Boss spec in end-game content, particularly with a Strand subclass. Shapeable. Supercluster is the first Strand pinpoint slug shotgun, and the good news is it has very competitive stats. The bad news is that they're not as great as they were a few years ago for boss DPS. Use the barrel perk to boost range and the mag perk to improve its utility - your preference between Assault Mag or Tactical Mag, or Appended Mag. Slice, as the first trait column perk, when procced after using your class ability reduces outgoing damage from a target by 40%, whether or not they're immune - very useful in boss fights or as part of a Bait and Switch weapon rotation. For a damage boosting perk in the second trait slot, choose between Surrounded, if you're likely to be in CQC with extra adds, or Vorpal Weapon for a reliable 15% boost to damage against Majors and Bosses. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red or an ally dies. You'll get a reload and 11s of a boost to range and either charge rate or handling.

First-choice PvE pick for Minor spec add clearing in general content. Shapeable. Lethophobia or "fear of forgetting", seeing as you're asking offers +20 Mobility and +6.25% movement speed as the Lightweight Frame bonus but, honestly the stats are poor and it's difficult to recommend for PvE. If you do want to try it out, the tactic with Bowstrong and Arrow perks is to reduce the draw time and improve accuracy. As the support perk in the first trait column, Successful Warm up improves draw time further, although you don't have to get a kill first, Explosive Head in the second as the signature perk is the reliable boost to damage and flinch that it always is. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red or an ally dies. You'll get a reload and 11s of a boost to range and either charge rate or handling.

// Doomed Petitioner PvE first-choice roll

First-choice PvE pick for sustained Boss spec damage in end-game content. Shapeable. Although Doomed Petitioner's stats are on the low side, if you don't already have a LFR for sustained boss damage, this will do nicely. A touch of stability and recoil direction from Chambered Compensator or Arrowhead Brake, and a maximised battery size of 6 with Ionized Battery sets you up nicely for Envious Assassin in the first trait column. Enhanced Envious Assassin will load 18 shots into the battery, leaving you 1 in reserve 2 with one Reserve mod, or 4 with two or three mods. You can choose between Enhanced Precision Instrument for 30% bonus damage after 6 crit hits or Enhanced Surrounded useful against Ir Yut for +47% damage when you're in a crowd. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red or an ally dies. You'll get a reload and 11s of a boost to range and either charge rate or handling.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Tigerspite has fairly middle-of-the-road stats and a more PvP-oriented trait pool but, if you like the subtype then there are a few interesting rolls. As with all precision weapon subtypes, you can start by not worrying too much about recoil direction, so you might as well push out the range with your barrel perk option. Any of the combat effect rounds in the mag perk slot Armor-Piercing, High-Caliber or Ricochet Rounds will add a tiny bit more range and utility in a firefight. In the first trait slot as the support perk, Subsistence really is the best maybe only trait that works for PvE while Frenzy is easy to proc and adds +15% damage, and 100 Handling and Reload, once it's procced. The Advanced Reflexes origin trait is quite useful in PvE - when activated by an enemy hit, it adds +30 Handling for additional ready and ADS speed, together with a handy +20 Mobility, for 7.5s. Recommended MW: Range or Stability, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

// Waking Vigil PvE first-choice roll
// Smallbore, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Extended Barrel, Full Bore, Armor-Piercing Rounds, High-Calibre Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Subsistence, Kinetic Tremors, Attrition Orbs, Rapid Hit, Perpetual Motion, Collective Action
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 91 https://open.spotify.com/episode/50NPk7xF3Tt6X3DVucE9jU?si=44d2b7d44a5a4aec with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with an arc subclass. As a former Lightweight HC that's been crowbarred into the Adaptive subfamily, the stats look very weird, with low range and stability but high handling and reload speed. If you haven't already got a decent arc hand cannon, then you could push out the range a bit, even at the cost of a little Handling, and add a little Stability. Any of the combat effect rounds in the mag perk slot Armor-Piercing, High-Caliber or Ricochet Rounds will add a tiny bit more range and utility in a firefight. Rapid Hit is the best support perk choice in the first column traits, although Perpetual Motion isn't bad either. Although you don't need Ionic Traces specifically to use Collective Action as the signature perk in the second trait column, they have the advantage over other elemental pickups in end-game content of tracking to you automatically, rather than having to go out to collect them, for a solid +20% damage boost for 7s. The Advanced Reflexes origin trait is quite useful in PvE - when activated by an enemy hit, it adds +30 Handling for additional ready and ADS speed, together with a handy +20 Mobility, for 7.5s.

// Vouchsafe PvE first-choice roll

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 91 https://open.spotify.com/episode/50NPk7xF3Tt6X3DVucE9jU?si=44d2b7d44a5a4aec with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, with a void subclass. The reprised Vouchsafe has returned with a plethora of PvE possibilities. You get the +20 Mobility from the Lightweight Frame, which is always great but on the downside you also have low Stability and Handling not such a problem with the origin trait and abysmal Recoil Direction. You can handle the wonky recoil with a combination of recoil and/or stability perks in the barrel and mag slots. Then, either Rapid Hit or Fourth Time's The Charm in the first, support, trait slot work well with Golden Tricorn in the second - you should be able to proc the second tier +50% damage with a void grenade to help deal with chunkier minor adds and the occasional major. The Advanced Reflexes origin trait is quite useful in PvE - when activated by an enemy hit, it adds +30 Handling for additional ready and ADS speed, together with a handy +20 Mobility, for 7.5s.

// Retold Tale PvE first-choice roll
// Barrel Shroud, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Assault Mag, Tactical Mag, Light Mag, Appended Mag, Repulsor Brace, Destabilizing Rounds
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 91 https://open.spotify.com/episode/50NPk7xF3Tt6X3DVucE9jU?si=44d2b7d44a5a4aec with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a void subclass. Retold Tale has okay stats compared to other precision frame shotguns and the trait pool is weighted towards PvP, but there's still some nice combinations here. First, for the barrel perk, Barrel Shroud, Smallbore or Corkscrew Rifling all add useful stats and for the mag slot while Assault Mag or Tactical Mag are the top two choices, Light Mag or Appended Mag aren't bad alternatives. For your trait combination, this is the first pellet shotgun that offers the the trait combination of Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds for aggressive CQC add clearing. You don't need a void subclass to make use of them - they'll work perfectly well without - but you can improve the effect with void fragments. The Advanced Reflexes origin trait is quite useful in PvE - when activated by an enemy hit, it adds +30 Handling or +20 charge rate with swords, for additional ready and ADS speed, together with a handy +20 Mobility, for 7.5s. Recommended MW: Range or Stability, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

// Twilight Oath PvE first-choice roll
// Chambered Compensator, Arrowhead Brake, Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Extended Mag, Envious Assassin, Precision Instrument, Vorpal Weapon
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 91 https://open.spotify.com/episode/50NPk7xF3Tt6X3DVucE9jU?si=44d2b7d44a5a4aec with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage to Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Twilight Oath starts in last place for stats amongst its peers, but it has one trick up its sleeve to make it useful for boss damage, if you don't already have a well-rolled special weapon for when you run out of heavy ammo. You'll need to start out by taming the wonky recoil with a Recoil Direction or Stability barrel perk. Tactical Mag, Appended Mag and Extended Mag all get you to the maximum of 7 shots - Tactical Mag adds some useful additional Stability too. You can use this with the trait combination of Envious Assassin, which can get 18 shots after 14 primary/heavy kills and up to 21 if you reproc, together with Precision Instrument, which provides a scaling damage bonus of up to +25% damage on the sixth and every subsequent crit hit. The Advanced Reflexes origin trait is quite useful in PvE - when activated by an enemy hit, it adds +30 Handling for additional ready and ADS speed, together with a handy +20 Mobility, for 7.5s.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage to Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. If you already have a solar boss damage sword, you can pass. If you want to use Abide the Return, then get a blade perk that increases damage and, for a guard perk, Swordmaster's Guard speeds up your heavy attack regeneration or Balanced Guard gives you a little bit of everything to help survive in CQC with a boss. The usual trait combination of Relentless Strikes, returning one ammo for everyth three light hits, and Whirlwind Blade for an escalating +3% bump to damage topping off at +30% for landing light hits makes for a decent, if not top-tier option for boss DPS phases. The Advanced Reflexes origin trait is quite useful in PvE - when activated by an enemy hit, it adds +20 charge rate for faster heavy attacks, together with a handy +20 Mobility, for 7.5s.

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a solar subclass. If you already have a solar boss damage sword, you can pass.

@description:New weapons and reprised, with the Dawning Surprise origin trait

// Cold Front PvE first-choice roll
// Polygonal Rifling, Smallbore, Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag, Steady Rounds, Stats For All, One For All

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Like most world-drop weapons, Cold Front has pretty poor stats - including a stability of just 7, although excluding Immortal, which is a stat monster, they're average for the frame subtype. Use the barrel and mag perks to help out with this and then the SOFA Stats/ One For All combination of trait perks to round out the stats further and add a chunky 35% bonus damage. The Dawning Surprise origin trait is very useful in PvE - when the behind the scenes counter hits 100, the surprise is spawned on the ground for 10sand grants energy 10% to all abilities, grants 20HP and starts shield/health regeneration.

// Avalanche PvE first-choice roll

First-choice PvE pick for sustained Boss Damage in end-game content. The stats are okay overall - there are a could of surprises with 90 Aim Assist and 19 Zoom, which are a lot higher than its peers - but unfortunately Avalanche has the lowest ammo reserves of any adaptive which limits its usefulness. If you already have a decent solar LMG, then you can pass. If you don't, Arrowhead Brake cleans up the recoil direction to 100, or Smallbore or Fluted Barrel boost useful stats as the barrel perk. Then, Extended Mag or Appended Mag both work as mag perks giving you more continuous shots on a single target. In the first trait column, as the support perk, the rounds that Rewind Rounds refills will count towards proccing the highest tiers of Target Lock as the second trait perk for sustained damage against a single target. The Dawning Surprise origin trait is very useful in PvE - when the behind the scenes counter hits 100, the surprise is spawned on the ground for 10s and grants 10% energy to all abilities, grants 20HP and starts shield/health regeneration.

// Avalanche PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Extended Mag, Appended Mag, Rewind Rounds, Subsistence, Incandescent
//notes: Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 91 https://open.spotify.com/episode/50NPk7xF3Tt6X3DVucE9jU?si=44d2b7d44a5a4aec with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for chunkier add-clearing against Minor Spec Enemies in general content with a solar subclass. The stats are okay overall - there are a could of surprises with 90 Aim Assist and 19 Zoom, which are a lot higher than its peers - but unfortunately Avalanche has the lowest ammo reserves of any adaptive which limits its usefulness. If you already have a decent solar LMG, then you can pass. If you don't, Arrowhead Brake cleans up the recoil direction to 100, or Smallbore or Fluted Barrel boost useful stats as the barrel perk. Then, Appended Mag, Extended Mag or Flared Magwell both work as mag perks giving you more continuous shots on a single target. To use as a heavy scort rifle for add-clearing, In the first trait column, as the support perk, the rounds that Rewind Rounds or Subsistence refills save time on reloads, while Incandescent helps you tie into solar subclass fragments to assist with add-clearing. The Dawning Surprise origin trait is very useful in PvE - when the behind the scenes counter hits 100, the surprise is spawned on the ground for 10s and grants 10% energy to all abilities, grants 20HP and starts shield/health regeneration. Recommended MW: Range, Stability or Handling, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

// Vengeful Whisper PvE first-choice roll
// Elastic String, Fiberglass Arrow Shaft, Straight Fletching, Slice, Collective Action
//notes: Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 90 https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C3Wx7xXVw10WshiLn5sT8?si=ZNEiHi_ZRfW5z3BbkOMrVQ with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways, and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for Strand Synergy in end-game content. Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Vengeful Whisper is no exception - even going as far as an extra point of zoom over other precision bows. This also has traits appearing in non-standard columns to make for some unique rolls. As with every bow, the aim is to reduce draw time first, and improve accuracy second - Elastic String does the first job and Fiberglass Arrow Shaft or Straight Fletching does the second. The combination of Slice in the first trait column and Collective Action in the second makes this a bit of a Swiss-army knife of weapons. Slice, with Strand of Continuity, Severs an enemy to reduce their damage output by 40% for 15s - you can use this effect on Majors and Bosses, even during an immunity phase to grant an effective 40% damage reduction for your whole fireteam. Or, apply Sever to a minor and kill it to spawn a Tangle that you can use with Collective Action for a 20% damage boost for 7s, then rinse and repeat. The origin trait is situationally useful if you're in a construct-heavy environment, like the Warlord's Ruin dungeon itself. Recommended MW: Draw Time, with a damage boosting Major, Boss or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

// Naeem's Lance PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Extended Mag, Reconstruction, Precision Instrument
//notes: Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 90 https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C3Wx7xXVw10WshiLn5sT8?si=ZNEiHi_ZRfW5z3BbkOMrVQ with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways, and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Naeem's Lance is no exception - having pretty good overall stats. It's the first Rapid-fire Sniper so, as is common for most snipers, Handling is a crucial stat but, as this is a rapid-fire frame, you'll also need to tidy up the recoil direction, so Arrowhead Brake is the barrel perk choice. As the mag perk, Tactical Mag is the best option, as it boosts stability a bit too, and gives the same rounds in the mag as Appended and Extended Mag. For the first trait, Reconstruction doubles your mag size passively while, if you don't have a good backup sniper for boss damage when you run out of heavy ammo, Precision Instrument boosts your damage output by 25% after six shots, for the rest of the 14-round magazine. The origin trait is situationally useful if you're in a construct-heavy environment, like the Warlord's Ruin dungeon itself.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 83 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ISDC0TSrLmfEyPuI9oU2m?si=9fbd5a7cf0bc4f07 with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for Stasis synergy and add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Horror Story has returned and become a stasis precision auto-rifle - the first of its subtype. The stats are unexceptional, as you might expect from an event weapon but there are some trait combinations to save it. Recoil direction doesn't really matter on a precision-frame weapon, and stability is less important with a more reliable recoil direction, so you can choose your pick of Handling, Range and Reload Speed from your barrel and mag perks. Enlightened Action will get you pretty close to maxed out Handling and Reload at 5 stacks, or Demolitionist is difficult to turn down when it shows up in the first trait column as the support perk. In the second as the signature perk, you should be able to proc Collective Action's 20% damage bonus from generating Stasis shards with Hunters and Titans Warlocks may have to work harder, or any other elemental pickup. Both origin traits are more PvP-orientated, but Nadir Focus's extra range and accuracy for free is a nice little bonus.

// Jurassic Green PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Accurized Rounds, Heal Clip, Frenzy
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 83 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ISDC0TSrLmfEyPuI9oU2m?si=9fbd5a7cf0bc4f07 with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for solar synergy and Minor Spec add-clearing in end-game content. Jurassic Green is a solar rapid-fire pulse, with the intrinsic 20% faster reload when its magazine is empty. It's got a similar stat range to its other world-drop peers, but comes a poor second to end-game drops in the energy slot. The recoil direction is a frankly awful 50 at base. The best even Arrowhead Brake can do is bring it up to a not entirely awful 80. Looking at the traits for this roll, the best option is to just increase the range with Accurized Rounds. The new to season 22 Heal Clip in the first trait column as the support perk will apply one stack of Cure to you and anyone else near on reloading after a kill, while Frenzy in the second column as the signature perk boosts handling and reload speed to 100, and adds 15% damage when procced. The Field Tested origin trait will just work steadily in the background to gradually improve your gunfeel, as long as you don't die!

First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec add-clearing in end-game content. Grenade launchers may not be anyone's first choice for add clearing, but Acosmic named after one of the two Hindu aspects of god; to be acosmic is to deny the objective reality of the temporal world - transcendental in a world-negating sense, according to Merriam-Webster is a void rapid-fire frame GL, with the intrinsic 20% faster reload when its magazine is empty, and is a viable option.. Get your blast radius as high as possible with your barrel and mag perks, so you can catch as many adds as possible with your shots. In the first trait column as the support perk, new to season 22 Loose Change boosts reload speed by 50 when you apply an elemental debuff, which is just what Destabilizing Rounds in the second column as the signature perk does. You should be able to clear crowded rooms fast and soften up beefier enemies. The Nadir Focus origin trait boosts your shot velocity further, which is a nice little bonus.

// Fang of Ir Yût PvE first-choice roll

First-choice PvE pick for Strand synergy and add clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content. Shapeable. This is the first rapid-fire Strand scout rifle so you get an Alloy Mag-like 20% quicker reload animation when the magazine is empty, with best-in-class stats compared to other RFs in the kinetic slot. The recoil direction is a bit shonky, so Arrowhead Brake cleans that up a bit, but if you feel able to control it, Fluted Barrel adds to handling for general snappiness. You can choose from any of the combat effect rounds as the mag perk, depending on your preference. For your Strand Synergy, Rapid Hit helps with reload speed and stability, or Rewind Rounds extends your magazine in the first trait column as the support park, while Hatchling is the Strand option-de-jour in the second column as the signature perk. The Cursed Thrall origin perk synergises well with melee builds and is a lot of fun for helping soften up groups of enemies when active.

First-choice PvE pick for Strand synergy and add clearing chunkier Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. Swordbreaker is back as a strand shotgun, has good stats - particularly the ones that matter most - and like all lightweights offers +20 Mobility and +6.25% movement speed. As with most shotguns, Handling matters most, so Barrel Shroud or Cockscrew Rifling both offer bumps as the barrel park. For the mag perk, Assault Mag increases rate-of-fire, which is always useful. To make the most of the Cursed Thrall origin trait, which synergises well with melee builds and is a lot of fun for helping soften up groups of enemies when active, Pugilist is an obvious choice in the first trait column as the support perk, regenerating melee energy on weapon kills. In the second, Golden Tricorn can help you make the most of the Strand melee abilities you're going to be in CQC, with a shotgun, setting yourself up for +50% damage for chunkier minors and the occasional major, and Cursed Thrall explosions on a kill.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear against Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. High Impact Auto-Rifles aren't really first choice for PvE - they do have good range, and the frame intrinsic provides more accuracy when stationary or slow-moving, but Abyss Defiant has great stats and trait combinations, so may be worth a try. Handling is always low on HIs, so Fluted Barrel is your top barrel perk choice, although Arrowhead Brake does take recoil direction to 100, so is a decent option as well. In the mag perk slot, Flared Magwell rounds out a few more gunfeel stats, or take the combat effect mag perk of your choice. For end-game activities, Enlightened Action in the first trait slot as the support perk provides passive boosts to reload and handling, which you should hit max stacks of quickly, and Collective Action in the second column as the signature perk is a reliable 20% damage boost for collecting an elemental pickup.

Handling is always low on HIs, so Fluted Barrel is your top barrel perk choice, although Arrowhead Brake does take recoil direction to 100, so is a decent option as well. In the mag perk slot, Flared Magwell rounds out a few more gunfeel stats, or take the combat effect mag perk of your choice. To make the most of the Cursed Thrall origin trait, which synergises well with melee builds and is a lot of fun for helping soften up groups of enemies when active, Pugilist is an obvious choice in the first trait column as the support perk, regenerating melee energy on weapon kills. In the second column as the signature perk, Swashbuckler is an obvious pairing, for a 33% damage boost at 5 stacks or you should be able to great an elemental pickup on a melee kill to pick up and proc Collective Action's 20% damage boost. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

// Oversoul Edict PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Flared Magwell, High-Caliber Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Enlightened Action, Voltshot
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 79 https://open.spotify.com/episode/1qz5FD88RfmGHDjedV6nGo?si=7e1c1558ecea4f1c with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for Arc synergy add-clear against Minor Spec enemies in general content. Shapeable. Oversoul Edict offers the usual rapid-fire intrinsic 20% faster reload animation when the mag is empty and middling stats by comarison with energy slot peers. Controlling the recoil direction means Arrowhead Brake is the best barrel perk, taking it to an almost not terrible 79. Take your choice of rounding out some of the gunfeel stats with Flared Magwell, or any of the combat effect magazine perks. In the first trait column as the support perk, Enlightened Action will take the base handling to 82 and reload speed to 84 within two bursts, if every shot hits. This will mean a fast reload to proc Voltshot after a kill to apply Jolt on enemies and tie in with your arc verbs. The Cursed Thrall origin perk synergises well with melee builds and is a lot of fun for helping soften up groups of enemies when active.

// Song of Ir Yût PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, High-Caliber Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Appended Mag, Flared Magwell, Unrelenting, Sword Logic
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 79 https://open.spotify.com/episode/1qz5FD88RfmGHDjedV6nGo?si=7e1c1558ecea4f1c with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for add-clear against chunkier Minor Spec enemies and the occasional major in end-game content. Shapeable. There's a lot of competition in the arc LMGs, and Song of Ir Yût has lower than average stats but saves itself with some nice trait perk combinations. Handling makes most weapons feel better - Fluted Barrel adds the most, but Arrowhead Brake also helps max out the recoil direction in the barrel perk slot. For the magazine perk, you can choose the combat effect mag of your preference, or maybe go with Appended Mag or Flared Magwell to round out the stats further. As the first trait column support perk, Unrelenting as the second column signature perk is great in end-game content for healing you and keeping you in a fight. You've got a pretty big mag, so you can use it to start and then escalate the new-to-season-22 Sword Logic perk damage tiers to rip through Minor Spec adds and the occasional Major. Maybe not so useful with this roll, but the Cursed Thrall origin perk synergises well with melee builds and is a lot of fun for helping soften up groups of enemies when active.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear against chunkier Minor Spec enemies and the occasional major in end-game content. Shapeable. There's a lot of competition in the arc LMGs, and Song of Ir Yût has lower than average stats but saves itself with some nice trait perk combinations. Handling makes most weapons feel better - Fluted Barrel adds the most, but Arrowhead Brake also helps max out the recoil direction in the barrel perk slot. Maximise your magazine size with Extended Mag or Appended Mag as the perk, and then in the first column as the support perk, you can then make the most of this with Rewind Rounds or Reconstruction so you can essentially keep firing til you run out of ammo. With this set-up, you can start and then escalate the new-to-season-22 Sword Logic perk damage tiers to rip through Minor Spec adds and Majors, and even an occasional boss. Maybe not so useful with this roll, but the Cursed Thrall origin perk synergises well with melee builds and is a lot of fun for helping soften up groups of enemies when active.

// The Showrunner PvE first-choice roll
// Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Ricochet Rounds, Well Rounded, Collective Action
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 78 https://open.spotify.com/episode/5KOQQ9QtvSEhRVb4vjeO3B?si=8c4784e02b87424e with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. The only other current lightweight SMG is Submission which is a stat monster, so Showrunner's stats look a bit poor by comparison, but there are still some interesting PvE rolls worth considering. Lightweights give you +20 Mobility and +6.25% to movement speed as the frame bonus to start. You can push out the range with the barrel perk - Hammer Forged Rifling or Smallbore both work well, and Ricochet Rounds pushes out the range a bit further and adds a bit more stability. There are plenty of ways to proc the gunfeel boosts you get from Well Rounded and, once you've done that you can collect any generated elemental pickups to proc Collective Action which is unusual to see on a Kinetic weapon for a 20% damage boost. The Nadir Focus Origin Trait adding range and accuracy on repeated hits isn't game-changing, but it is nice to have.

In the first trait column, as the support perk, Overflow lets you get to the highest stacks of single-target damage from Target Lock in the second column as the signature perk, for beefier Minor Spec adds.

// Persuader PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Tactical Mag, Appened Mag, Extended Mag, Rapid Hit, Triple Tap
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 78 https://open.spotify.com/episode/5KOQQ9QtvSEhRVb4vjeO3B?si=8c4784e02b87424e with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for short phases of sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Even with some decent stats, honestly, there are better rapid-fire sniper options out there for sustained boss damage in a short damage window think Caretaker or Golgoroth, but if you haven't got one of them already, then Persuader can be made to work in the meantime. Start with Arrowhead Brake to control the recoil and boost handling, and add Tactical Mag for 7 shots in the chamber Appended and Extended Mag offer nothing better. The combination of Rapid Hit in the first trait column as the support perk - which adds stability, maximises reload speed together with a reload animation scalar - and Triple Tap in the second column as the signature perk, which lets you get off 10 crit shots without reloading, should provide a decent stopgap. The Nadir Focus Origin Trait adding range and accuracy on repeated hits isn't game-changing, but it is nice to have.

First-choice PvE pick for Solar synergy and add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content although you'll be brave to be that close!. Heliocentric translation "sun-centred" has great base stats, so you can go for a little extra range, stability or handling with your barrel park - that's pretty much down to your preference. Reload Speed will be the most important magazine perk stat boost, so Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag or even Alloy Mag are good picks. The new to S22 Heal Clip as the first column support perk provides you and any one nearby with a burst of Cure when you reload after a kill. In the second column as the signature perk, Frenzy passively provides maximum Handling and Reload Speed when procced, together with a solid 15% damage boost, or Surrounded gives passive +40% damage for being in CQC. The Nadir Focus Origin Trait adding range and accuracy on repeated hits isn't game-changing, but it is nice to have.

// Geodetic HSm PvE first-choice roll
// Tempered Edge, Hungry Edge, Enduring Blade, Burst Guard, Repulsor Brace, Destabilizing Rounds
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 78 https://open.spotify.com/episode/5KOQQ9QtvSEhRVb4vjeO3B?si=8c4784e02b87424e with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Geodetic which means relating to the branch of applied mathematics concerned with the size and shape of the Earth is a bit of a curious beast - having +2 Impact compared to other legendary swords excluding Bequest and +27 Charge Rate again, excepting Bequest. If you're looking for an add-clear weapon, you might want to to look at Blade perks that boost your ammo capacity - one hit is likely to kill even in end-game content. Again, you're probably not looking to use the charged attack that frequently, so Burst Guard could be more useful to survive in CQC. This is the first sword that offers the trait combination of Repulsor Brace in the first column as the support perk and Destabilizing Rounds in the second as the signature perk, continuously generating a Void overshield and applying volatility to carve your way through adds. The Nadir Focus Origin Trait boosts lunge distance - a bit like an Eager Edge lite that's permanently up, which could be useful in the Crota's End Abyss encounter. Recommended MW: Impact, with a damage-boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, pve-endgame, mkb, controller

Geodetic which means relating to the branch of applied mathematics concerned with the size and shape of the Earth is a bit of a curious beast - having +2 Impact compared to other legendary swords excluding Bequest and +27 Charge Rate again, excepting Bequest. Even if you have already got a sword decked out for Major or Boss damage, this already starts out doing more damage, so set it up as usual with a damage-boosting blade perk, ideally Jagged Edge, with Swordmaster's Guard as the guard perk. Then pair Relentless Strikes to regene4rate ammo one every third strike in the first trait column as the support perk with Whirlwind Blade in the second column as the signature perk to boost damage up up to 30% at 10 stacks. The Nadir Focus Origin Trait boosts lunge distance - a bit like an Eager Edge lite that's permanently up, which could be useful in the Crota's End Abyss encounter.

// Dead Messenger PvE first-choice roll
// Hard Launch, High-Velocity Rounds, The Fundamentals, Short-Action Stock, Unrelenting, Demolitionist
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 78 https://open.spotify.com/episode/5KOQQ9QtvSEhRVb4vjeO3B?si=8c4784e02b87424e with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Dead Messenger still needs a little love as at v7.2.0.5, even if it does come with a fair few extras built-in. With Blast Radius and Stability being pointless, you might as well maximise Velocity with Hard Launch as the barrel perk, and High-Velocity Rounds as the mag perk. Short-Action Stock is the only useful choice as the stock perk, and then as your selectable perk, Unrelenting is good to recover health in a firefight, or Demolitionist should still work even though you only get 10% grenade energy per hit, as with a wave-frame you should catch multiple adds with each shot. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

// Unending Tempest PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Smallbore, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Demolitionist, Adrenaline Junkie, Collective Action
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5 with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec add clear enemies in end-game content. Unending Tempest is probably the best kinetic slot precision SMG, with great stats in comparison to its peers, and with being able to forget about the recoil direction with the frame bonus. But, as it's a Crucible weapon, there is a huge trait pool, so if you do want the best chance of a usable drop, reset your ranks a few times first, before you focus your engrams. You'll appreciate a mix of handling, stability and reload speed from your barrel and mag perks. Fluted Barrel is the obvious top pic for the barrel, but Smallbore is a decent alternative, and then Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell boost the stats you need from the mag. It's always great to see Demolitionist in the first trait column as a support perk for more grenades, and who doesn't love that, and the occasional instant refill when you throw one. In the second trait column as the signature perk, Adrenaline Junkie is a natural pairing, as is Collective Action from the elemental pickups you can generate from grenades. The Nadir Focus origin trait in may be more PvP orientated, but free extra range and accuracy is a nice bonus. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a damage-boosting Minor or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, pve-endgame, mkb, controller

// Qua Xaphan V PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Arrowhed Brake, Corkscrew Rifling, Ricochet Rounds, High-Caliber Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Triple Tap, Clown Cartridge, Target Lock, Frenzy, Firing Line
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5 with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. The name literally means "in the character or role of Xaphan" - a fallen angel that rebelled with Satan, and a demon of the second order associated with fire, which doesn't really fit with a void weapon, but there you go. To be honest, if you have a decently rolled void boss-damage LMG, you can ignore Qua Xaphan - it has pretty bad stats. If you are looking for a more easily obtainable one to fill a gap, remember this is a Gambit weapon, so reset your reputation a few times before focusing any engrams. Handling is the usual play for Aggressive LMGs, so Fluted Barrel is the top barrel choice, with Arrowhead Brake and Corkscrew Rifling as decent alternates. Any of the combat effect mag perks Ricochet Rounds, High-Caliber Rounds or Armor-Piercing Rounds will work, or Flared Magwell is an option to speed up reload speed. As the first trait column support perk, particularly for sustained boss damage, Triple Tap and Clown Cartridge work - Triple Tap can add up to 12 additional shots, and Clown Cartridge between 5 and 22. For additional damage, in the second column support perk, you can hit the higher damage stacks of Target Lock with your overflowed rounds, take a straight 15% damage and maxed handling and reload speed with Frenzy, or 20% additional damage in a fireteam with Firing Line. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a damage-boosting Boss or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-boss, pve-god, pve-endgame, mkb, controller

// Qua Xaphan V PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Arrowhed Brake, Corkscrew Rifling, Ricochet Rounds, High-Caliber Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Field Prep, Destabilizing Rounds
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5 with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. The name literally means "in the character or role of Xaphan" - a fallen angel that rebelled with Satan, and a demon of the second order associated with fire, which doesn't really fit with a void weapon, but there you go. To be honest, if you have a decently rolled void LMG, you can ignore Qua Xaphan - it has pretty bad stats. If you are looking for a more easily obtainable one to fill a gap, remember this is a Gambit weapon, so reset your reputation a few times before focusing any engrams. Handling is the usual play for Aggressive LMGs, so Fluted Barrel is the top barrel choice, with Arrowhead Brake and Corkscrew Rifling as decent alternates. Any of the combat effect mag perks Ricochet Rounds, High-Caliber Rounds or Armor-Piercing Rounds will work, or Flared Magwell is an option to speed up reload speed. If you want to use this as a heavy scout rifle, for add clear, Field Prep, for the boost to reserves and reload speed is the best option in the first trait column as the support perk, and Destabilizing Rounds gives you access to volatility effects even if you're not using a void subclass, for great add-clearing.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5 with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing beefier Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Solid stats by comparison with its Precision Bow peers, and some decent PvE traits mean this is worth focusing a few Iron Banner engrams if you've not already got a decent one. As ever with bows, we're looking to reduce the draw time with the bowstring, so Elastic String is the top choice, with Polymer String and Flexible String being decent alternate choices. Then, to recover the lost accuracy with the arrow perk, choose between Fiberglass Arrow Shaft or Straight Fletching. Point of the Stag is the first bow that offers the trait combination of the ever reliable Archer's Tempo as the support perk to speed up draw time, and the new to Season 22 Precision Instrument as the signature perk for an escalating boost to damage - maybe better to use for repeated crits against a single target than for clearing groups of adds.

// The Guiding Sight PvE first-choice roll#// Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Polygonal Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Flared Magwell, Armor-Piercing Rounds, High-Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Enlightened Action, Precision Instrument
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5 with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for clearing beefier Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. The good news is that reprised Guiding Sight is now a Strand Scout Rifle. the bad news is that it's still a high-Impact frame, so it's the least competitive subtype. The stats are decent, so this might be an easier to obtain option, if you've not got a Strand scout already. With the barrel, you can buff some of the low stats - Handling and Stability, and then the mag can help with the reload speed, or just choose from one of the combat effect mags. The pairing of Enlightened Action as the first column support trait to boost Handling and Reload Speed and Precision Instrument in the second column signature perk for an escalating damage buff on crits is a natural pairing to help with long-range add clearing. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a damage-boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, pve-endgame, mkb, controller

// Pre Astyanax IV PvE first-choice roll
// Elastic String, Polymer String, Flexible String, Fiberglass Arrow Shaft, Straight Fletching, Archer's Tempo, Shoot to Loot, Explosive Head
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5 with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for add clear of Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. The literal translation means "Before Astyanax". Astyanax “Lord of the City”, in Greek legend, is the Trojans' popular nickname for the son of the city's greatest warrior, Prince Hector of Troy, and his wife Andromache. If you haven't got a well-rolled solar Precision bow, this is your chance - the stats are poor, but there are still decent trait combos to chase. If you do, then you can happily pass this by. As ever with bows, we're looking to reduce the draw time with the bowstring, so Elastic String is the top choice, with Polymer String and Flexible String being decent alternate choices. Then, to recover the lost accuracy with the arrow perk, choose between Fiberglass Arrow Shaft or Straight Fletching. Archer's Tempo is the usual reliable choice as the support perk to speed up draw time, but you might also look at Shoot to Loot for picking up ammo bricks remotely in end-game content. In the second trait column as the signature perk, Explosive Head adds a passive boost to damage and adds flinch, and increases the radius for a Shoot to Loot ammo pickup. Recommended MW: Draw Time or Reload Speed, with a damage-boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, pve-endgame, mkb, controller

First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. The reprised Warden's Law is the first of a new Heavy Burst subtype, so there's nothing to compare it against. The stats look like those of a 120 but with less range and, although the magazine looks generous, every trigger pull shoots two bullets so in reality, you'll only have 8 shots at base. Handling and Stability could both do with a bump, but we can sort handling with traits, so Polygonal Rifling provides the biggest boost, followed by Smallbore, Fluted Barrel and then Corkscrew Rifling. We can sort reload speed out with a trait too, so you can maximise the rounds with Extended Mag, or play a little safer with Appended Mag or Tactical Mag. In the first trait column as the support perk, the most useful option is Fourth Time's the Charm, and then Frenzy as the second column signature perk maximises handling and reload speed along with the useful 15% buff to damage. Recommended MW: Stability, with a damage-boosting Minor or Taken Spec, or Backup Mag mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, pve-endgame, mkb, controller

// Igneous Hammer PvE first-choice roll

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5 with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Igneous Hammer is back, with the best stats of any Aggressive Hand Cannons in the game as at v7.2.0.3, and a new and very chasable trait pairing. Handling and Stability could both do with a bump, but we can sort handling with traits, so Polygonal Rifling provides the biggest boost in the barrel, followed by Chambered Compensator, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel and then Corkscrew Rifling. We can sort reload speed out with a trait too, so you can choose any of the combat effect rounds as your mag perk. In the first trait column as the support perk, the new combination worth chasing is Heal Clip, for the Cure for yourself and nearby fireteam on reloads after a kill, and then Frenzy as the second column signature perk to maximise handling and reload speed along with the useful 15% buff to damage. Recommended MW: Stability, with a damage-boosting Minor or Taken Spec, or Backup Mag mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, pve-endgame, mkb, controller

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5 with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Cataphract starts off with excellent stats against it's heavy adaptive grenade launcher peers, and just gets better. Start off with increasing the velocity with the barrel perk so enemies have as little time to evade as possible - Quick Launch is the top pick as it bumps handling too, but Hard Launch, Smart Drift Control or even Linear Compensator can work. In the magazine, choose between Augmented Drum, for the extra round at base, or Spike Grenades for the additional 10% damage. For sustained damage, you should aim to overfill the magazine with Envious Assassin as the first trait column support perk - 15 rapid kills will get you 18 in the mag with Augmented Drum or 15 with Spike Grenades, and bypass reload time altogether. Finally, Bait and Switch's 10s of 35% bonus damage when procced should be enough time to unload everything into your boss of choice.

First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. Brya's Love - named after Eris's Ghost - is up against Doom of Chelchis as a void precision frame scout rifle so, as you'd expect, doesn't fare well in a straight stat comparison. There are still some useful and unique trait combinations available to craft. For the barrel perk, Fluted Barrel or Smallbore are probably your top two choices - as a precision frame, the recoil direction stat doesn't really matter - or you could opt to go all into Stability with Polygonal Rifling or range with Hammer-Forged Rifling. For the magazine perk, Tactical Mag is the best choice, or possibly Appended mag of one more shot. As your support trait, the new to season 21 perk Loose Change adds 50 to reload speed when you apply an elemental debuff, which when you pair it with Destabilizing Rounds as your second trait column signature perk is just what you'll be doing on a kill. Whether you find the Head Rush origin trait useful will depend on how often you crouch and get up again - if you do, the additional handling and reload speed is useful, if not game-changing.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content - only keep if you don't have an existing crafted Thoughtless. Shapeable. Locus Locutus Latin translation could be something like "place of speaking" has tough competition from the aforementioned Thoughtless, which offers better stats and much the same PvE perk pool. If you haven't got one, then Arrowhead Brake improves handling and recoil direction, and Tactical Mag gets you to the maximum mag size of 5, and adds stability and reload speed. Overflow pushes you to an almost comical 11 in the mag on an ammo pickup, and Fighting Line boosts precision damage by 20% when you're close to at least two fireteam members - ideal for sustained damage phases against slow-moving or Divinity-debuffed bosses. Whether you find the Head Rush origin trait useful will depend on how often you crouch and get up again - if you do, the additional handling and reload speed is useful, if not game-changing.

First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Major Spec enemies and sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. The Eremite named after a religious recluse, being the root for the word hermit, is a bit of a season 21 banger! Although the stats are below average, this should be on your list of weapons you aim to farm and craft. Fluted Barrel as the barrel perk bumps up handling and adds a dash of stability, but then go all in to battery size with ionized Battery. Enhanced Envious Assassin as the first trait column support perk bypasses the poor reload speed and can cram in up 18 shots somehow, after 15 rapid kills with other weapons, which means that you can go ham with Controlled Burst as the second column signature perk - 20% bonus damage and 10% quicker charge time, just for landing all your bolts. Alternatively in the same slot, Reservoir Burst can take your magazine size up to 20 and adds 25% damage to the first 15 shots. Either should be enough to chunk down champions or last a damage phase against a raid boss. Whether you find the Head Rush origin trait useful will depend on how often you crouch and get up again - if you do, the additional handling and reload speed is useful, if not game-changing.

First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against Boss Spec enemies in end-game content. Shapeable. If you're interested, a Semiotician is someone who studies semiotics - symbols and meanings think Tom Hanks' "Symbologist" character in the Da Vinci Code. While High Impact rocket launchers aren't optimum for damage - doing 10% less damage than adaptives and aggressives - this is still the best Strand RL cvailable as at season 21, with great stats at base. If you're using this against a boss, velocity is more impart and than blast radius, so Quick Launch is your best barrel perk choice, and Impact Casing in the mag adds a little extra damage it all helps!. For your boss damage roll, enhanced Field Prep as the first trait column support park boosts the reload speed but, more importantly, is the equivalent of two reserve mods so you only need one to get to the maximum of 10. But then if you add Bipod as your second column signature perk, you can end up with 15 total rockets, which should be plenty for a damage phase, and Field Prep more than offsets the reload penalty. Whether you find the Head Rush origin trait useful will depend on how often you crouch and get up again - if you do, the additional handling and reload speed is useful, if not game-changing.

Recommended MW: Velocity, with a damage-boosting Minor, or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, pve-endgame, mkb, controller

@title:Season 21 Ghost of the Deep Dungeon weapons
@description:Ghost of the Deep Dungeon weapons with the Restoration Ritual origin trait

// New Pacific Epitaph PvE first-choice roll
// Quick Launch, High-Velocity Rounds, Demolitionist, Lead From Gold, Unrelenting, Collective Action
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 67 https://open.spotify.com/episode/3wGaXiUGMNodLkPkGFdBd3?si=42e0db2e63a443b7 with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities. New Pacific Epitaph is the first kinetic slot wave frame grenade launcher, so there's no direct comparison, but compared to the energy slot versions the stats are decent. As ever, play is to get the shot speed as high as you can, so Quick Launch in the barrel and High-Velocity Rounds in the magazine are the best choices. For use against endgame minor adds, as the first trait column support perk Demolitionist which returns 20% grenade energy on special weapons, and allows for an instant reload on a grenade throw, or Lead from Gold for ammo economy, or Unrelenting to help you stay alive all work well. In the second column as the signature Perk, Collective Action should be easy to proc with all the Elemental Pickups now available, for a 20% damage boost for 7s. The Restoration Ritual origin trait is also occasionally useful for an instant reload after proccing. Recommended MW: Velocity, with a damage-boosting Minor or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

// No Survivors PvE first-choice roll
// Polygonal Rifling, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Flared Magwell, Armor-Piercing Rounds, High-Calibre Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Demolitionist, Incandescent
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 67 https://open.spotify.com/episode/3wGaXiUGMNodLkPkGFdBd3?si=42e0db2e63a443b7 with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities, particularly for solar synergy. No Survivors has decent stats - high range, handling and recoil direction but low stability. We can help that with stability options in the barrel and mag, although with the high rate of fire and high chance you'll be in CQC, any of the combat effect mag perks will work. If you missed out on an Incandescent Calus Mini-Tool, you can roll something similar by using Demolitionist in the first trait slot as the support perk, and Incandescent in the second slot as the signature perk. Incandescent kills count as weapon kills, so every energy that dies to scorch or ignite damage will grant 10% energy as well as direct kills. Add your pick of Embers of Tempering, Char, Eruption, Ashes, Mercy or Searing to turn this into a CQC add-clear beast. The Restoration Ritual origin trait is also occasionally useful for an instant reload after proccing. Recommended MW: Stability, with a damage-boosting Minor or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

We can help that with stability options in the barrel and mag, although with the high rate of fire and high chance you'll be in CQC, any of the combat effect mag perks will work. In your first trait slot as the support perk, Demolitionist is always useful but, to boost the gunfeel stats, Surplus and Well-Rounded can also work well. Then, in the second trait slot as the signature perk, Collective Action boosts damage by 20% for collecting an Elemental Pickup any pickup, not just Firesprites. Add in Embers of Tempering and Mercy to proc and keep Collective Action going and boost restoration, and this turns into an add-clearing machine.

// Rapacious Appetite PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Chambered Compensator, Smallbore, Polygonal Rifling, Flared Magwell, Ricochet Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, High-Caliber Rounds, Perpetual Motion, Headstone
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 61 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XT0gPkoVSh3cM6gMtSupq?si=18db495353ca49ad with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for Stasis Synergy minor add clear in endgame activities. Shapeable. Rapacious Appetite is one of only two Stasis aggressive SMGs as at S21, so there's not much to compare the stats against. But even so, the stability of 6 might make you pause. On the plus side, the range is the highest in the subfamily. You'll need stability on a controller, so start with a stability barrel and a Stability masterwork. In the mag, Flared Magwell or the Combat Effect perks all provide utility. The easiest way to add the gunfeel stats you need in an end-game roll is through Perpetual Motion in the first trait column as your support perk and then, to synergise with Stasis subclasses, Headstone in the second column as the signature perk, of you don't already have a Headstone Blood Feud SMG, provides a Stasis crystal on crit kills to use with Aspects and Fragments. Recommended MW: Stability, with a damage-boosting Minor or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities. Shapeable. Rapacious Appetite is one of only two Stasis aggressive SMGs as at S21, so there's not much to compare the stats against. But even so, the stability of 6 might make you pause. On the plus side, the range is the highest in the subfamily. You'll need stability on a controller, so start with a stability barrel and a Stability masterwork. In the mag, Flared Magwell or the Combat Effect perks all provide utility. The easiest way to add the gunfeel stats you need in an end-game roll is through Perpetual Motion in the first trait column as your support perk and then, in the second column as the signature perk, One For All is an easy-to-proc 35% boost to damage for add clear, or to take on the occasional major. Recommended MW: Stability, with a damage-boosting Minor or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

// Different Times PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Flared Magwell, Ricochet Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, High-Caliber Rounds, Stats For All, Collective Action
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 61 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XT0gPkoVSh3cM6gMtSupq?si=18db495353ca49ad with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities. Shapeable. Different Times is the first Strand pulse rifle but has poor base stats when compared with other kinetic slot options. The Recoil Direction is awful, so Arrowhead Brake is pretty much a must have in the barrel. Flared Magwell fills in some gunfeel stats, or the Combat Effect magazine perks are all viable. In the first trait column for the support perk, Stats For All makes the gun feel very usable and, as this is the first primary weapon able to roll Collective Action, in the second column as the signature perk, that's probably the roll to go for for end-game content, proccing 20% bonus damage for any elemental pickup.

First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in end-game content. Shapeable. Unfortunately, Targeted Redaction looks great, but has poor stats by comparison with other void adaptive hand cannons. If you already have a decent Bottom Dollar roll, you can probably give this a pass. If you don't, then fill in the stat gaps as best you can - Fluted Barrel or Smallbore, and Tactical Mag all bump useful gunfeel stats and increase the mag size to 9. For end-game use, Triple Tap as the first trait column support park and Explosive Payload or Frenzy as the second column signature perk are tried-and-true combinations to passively extend your magazine and boost damage.

First-choice PvE pick for Minor add-clearing in end-game content. Shapeable. Thin Precipice is the first Strand sword, and is the fan-favourite vortex spin-to-win frame to boot. As with all swords, Jagged Edge is the usual choice for the blade for its increased damage. and Swordmaster's Guard bumps charge time for heavy spin attacks. There aren't many swords that can roll both Unrelenting in the first trait column as the support perk, and Chain Reaction in the second column as the signature perk - the combination should mean you can safely wade into crowds of adds, and enjoy the explosions around you that proc your health regeneration.

As with all swords, Jagged Edge is the usual choice for the blade for its increased damage. To pair with your traits, you'll want to go with heavy guard, mainly to slow your charge time. The play here is to use unpowered heavy attacks, which do a bit less damage but only cost 1 ammo, to proc Tireless Blade in the first trait column as the support perk and refund ammo for every other kill - if you're lucky you can return more ammo than you use. In the second column as the signature perk, Golden Tricorn's first stack will easily make up the reduced damage after the first kill, or Chain Reaction's AoE damage should mean you can wade into crowds of adds, while never running out of ammo.

// Spare Rations PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Smallbore, Flared Magwell, Appended Mag, Rapid Hit, Slideshot, Kinetic Tremors
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 61 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XT0gPkoVSh3cM6gMtSupq?si=18db495353ca49ad with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for Minor add-clearing in end-game content. Spare Rations is in a difficult place stats-wise still having the lower stats of the old 150 Lightweight subfamily even though it's been rolled into the Adaptives. However, it's the first hand cannon that can drop with Kinetic Tremors, so it might be worth keeping around in case a rework makes it a bit easier to proc. Fill in some of the stats with the barrel - Fluted Barrel or Smallbore bump your preference between range, stability and handling. In the mag, Flared Magwell bumps stats up a bit more, or Appended Mag gets you to the maximum of 14 shots. For end-game add clearing Rapid Hit is the best choice for the first trait column support park - stacking buffs to stability and reload speed or, if you can run and slide, Slideshot partially reloads and applies passive range and stability bumps. In the second column as the signature perk, Kinetic Tremors does currently v7.1.0.2, S21 take six hits to proc, but if that's ever given a buff, this could be great for AoE damege for a group of adds while collecting ammo and orbs remotely.

First-choice PvE pick for Solar synergy and Minor add-clearing in end-game content. If you haven't got an Incandescent Calus Mini-Tool, the Bug-Out Bag could be a very acceptable alternative. Decent stats but, if you get Threat Detector as a perk, you can pretty much ignore stability, handling and reload with your barrel choices, so you might as well control the recoil a little instead - Extended Barrel or Chambered Compensator take the Recoil Direction to a near-perfect 98. Any of the Combat Effect magazine perks adds utility, and a little range on top. In the first trait column as the support perk, Threat Detector at two stacks takes stability to around 80 and maxes out handling and reload speed and Incandescent as the second column signature perk is great for add clearing and builds into your scorch and ignite Solar verbs.

First-choice PvE pick for end-game use in general activities. Shapeable. Not a huge selection of Lightweight Pulse Rifles to compare with, but Chattering Bone is still best-in-class stats across the board, and provides a +20 mobility bonus and 6.25% faster movement speed. Even if it's best in class, the recoil direction still needs attention - Arrowhead Break takes it to a controllable 87, and adds a bump to handling. Either Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell in the magazine add reload speed, stability and, for the former, an extra burst. Pair that with Rapid Hit in the first trait column as the support perk, to make successive bursts easier to land and boost reload speed further. Finally, as the second column signature perk, Kinetic Tremors only needs four bursts to land to proc. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear use in end-game activities. Shapeable. Transfiguration is the only obtainable high-impact scout rifle available as at S21, plus it has a solid set of stats, although reload is a bit slow. The range is pretty good - Fluted Barrel, Smallbore or Corkscrew Rifling all add useful bumps to stats, or if you want to push the range out by a few metres more, Hammer-Forged Rifling can also work in the barrel. Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell are the pick of the magazine perks, adding useful reload speed, a bit of stability and an extra shot for Tac Mag. Explosive Payload in the second trait column as the signature perk is a straight boost to damage, with added flinch, and is great against champions. Working back, you could pair it with either Rewind Rounds, to extend the magazine - particularly useful with champions, or look to increasing your damage output with Rampage - Three stacks equates to an impressive extra 44.5% crit damage. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

// The Supremacy PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Polygonal Rifling, Chambered Compensator, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Appended Mag, Rewind Rounds, Fourth Times the Charm
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 69 https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZIEMYfNzOu5TyLlLhU7hH?si=90ffff909a2e40f2 with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects - @ImpetusAlways is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for sustained damage against bosses in end-game activities. Shapeable. The Supremacy has decent in-band stats by comparison with other kinetic slot rapid-fire snipers. Putting out shots at pace needs some additional control with the barrel perk - you could improve the recoil direction, or you can increase the stability. Appended Mag gets you to the maximum of 7 in the mag without needing to use Extended Mag. The roll that's been dubbed "Whisper Lite" combines Enhanced Rewind Rounds in the first trait column as the support perk refunds 70% of the shots that hit from reserves when the magazine's emptied. Fourth Time's the Charm in the second slot as the signature perk magics two bullets out of thin air after hitting four rapid crits. Between the two, it's been reported that with 3x Reserve mods you can hit 42 crits in a row without reloading - very handy to have in your back pocket against a boss if you run out of power ammo, or if you're running Tractor Cannon and need a damage option. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too. Recommended MW: Stability, with a damage-boosting Boss or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-boss, pve-god, pve-endgame, mkb, controller

// Age-Old Bond PvE first-choice roll
// Polygonal Rifling, Chambered Compensator, Arrowhead Brake, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Repulsor Brace, Destabilising Rounds
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 69 https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZIEMYfNzOu5TyLlLhU7hH?si=90ffff909a2e40f2 with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects - @ImpetusAlways is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for minor add-clear in end-game activities, particularly for Void synergy. Shapeable. There aren't many high-impact auto rifles in the game, even fewer dropping from activities and Age-Old Bond is the only void example. You have to enjoy slower-firing weapons, but if that's the case this has great stats. Being slower firing, the reticule has more time to return to the centre, so a bit of extra stability and/or recoil direction will make it very easy to control. In the magazine, Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell are both great choices - the difference being whether you prefer a couple of extra bullets or a slightly faster reload. This is one of only two primaries that can roll with Repulsor Brace in the first column, as the support perk, and Destabilising Rounds in the second as the signature perk. In a similar way to Incandescent and Voltshot, this means you can enjoy void verb use whether you're sporting a void subclass or not although if you are, you have access to the full 3.0 kit of fragments you can use. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

// Tyranny of Heaven PvE first-choice roll
// Elastic String, Straight Fletching, Explosive Head, Dragonfly, Incandescent
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 69 https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZIEMYfNzOu5TyLlLhU7hH?si=90ffff909a2e40f2 with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects - @ImpetusAlways is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for minor add-clear in end-game activities, particularly for solar synergy. Shapeable. Okay, it's a Lightweight bow, which isn't ideal but on the bright side, you do get the +20 mobility and 6.25% movement speed increase, and this is the only solar example available. The stats aren't great either but, as a Raid weapon, this can still roll with some spicy trait combinations. As usual, we'll use the combination of Elastic String in the bowstring slot, and Straight Fletching as the arrow to drop the draw time and recover the lost accuracy it's already a pretty awful 27, so get used to using this closer up than a precision bow. The unique rolls available include Explosive Head for a straight 9.4% damage boost and tiny bit of AoE damage or Dragonfly for a more satisfying crit kill explosion in the first trait slot as the support perk, together with Incandescent as the second slot signature perk for scorch and ignite - even better with solar 3.0 verbs if you're running a matching subclass with access to useful fragments. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

// Nation of Beasts PvE first-choice roll
// Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Extended Barrel, Chambered Compensator, Flared Magwell, Perpetual Motion, Eddy Current, Voltshot
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 69 https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZIEMYfNzOu5TyLlLhU7hH?si=90ffff909a2e40f2 with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects - @ImpetusAlways is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for minor add-clear in end-game activities, particularly for arc synergy. Shapeable. National of Beasts has average stats in comparison to its peers, but a spicy Raid perk pool to play with. Take your pick of a little extra range, stability or recoil speed for the barrel perk. In the magazine, Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell are both great choices - the difference being whether you prefer an bullets or a slightly faster reload. If you want to build into Voltshot as your second trait column signature perk, you'll want your first column support perk to boost reload speed as much as possible. The new Eddy Current sounds like it might do the job, but you'll have to sprinting for 3s after a kill to proc it, which gives you a tiny window to reload of 0.8s or less, so good old Perpetual Motion is probably the more reliable option. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too. Recommended MW: Reload Speed, with a damage-boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, pve-endgame, mkb, controller

Aggressive hand cannons have two main weaknesses - handling and reload speed. Fortunately, there are season 21 perk combinations that can help with that! Start with adding handling or a little extra stability with your barrel perk. You can go one of two ways with the magazine - either look for a perk that helps with reload or enjoy a combat effect perk and let the traits do the heavy lifting. While there are additional reload perks in the first trait column, you shouldn't really need them, so Wellspring offers useful ability energy on kills as your support trait. Then, in the second trait column as your signature perk, Frenzy maxes out handling and reload speed when procced, as well as providing a solid 15% weapon damage boost. The Dream Works origin trait is useful in a fireteam to get the occasional overflowed magazine in a firefight.

Aggressive hand cannons have two main weaknesses - handling and reload speed. So. start with adding handling or a little extra stability with your barrel perk, and look for a perk that helps with reload in your magazine. In the second trait column, as your signature perk, the second tier of Golden Tricorn can be difficult to proc with Stasis - shattering a target that's frozen with a Glacier Grenade will do it or, if you're a Hunter, your Shurikens will also work. To support that, you could go one of two ways with your first column trait - Rapid Hit, to speed up the reload speed and take full advantage of the 50% damage boost, or Pugilist to get melee energy back so you can proc it again sooner. The Dream Works origin trait is useful in a fireteam to get the occasional overflowed magazine in a firefight.

First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in end-game activities. Buzzard is a sidearm so it's likely to be less than optimal for end-game content, as you have to be very close to use one. It's got good stats overall, but the subfamily is all quite compressed. We can get pretty much every stat close to 100 with this particular roll, except for range so max that out with Full Bore in the barrel, a range Masterwork and any of the Combat Effect magazine perks. In the first trait column as the support perk, Encore wouldn't normally be under consideration, as it's mainly thought of as a PvP perk, but at four stacks it adds -5% accuracy cone growth for easier crits, 20 Range and 32 Stability. With Frenzy in the second trait slot as the signature perk procced, you end up with range of 86, stability of 89 or 99 depending on the mag, and handling and reload speed at 100, as well as the useful 15% damage boost.

// THE SWARM PvE first-choice roll

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear in end-game activities. It's difficult to love the reprised SWARM for PvE when the best damage perk has been lost, and the PvE options in both trait columns are weak. The only viable use is for minor add-clear as a kind of heavy scout rifle, but if you already have an older Bottomless Grief/One For All roll, just keep that and move on. If you do want to hold on to one, you could make an argument for any barrel perk - Fluted Barrel, for the handling and stability, Polygonal Rifling, for the big stability bump or Full Bore for the range bump, for example. In the mag, Appended Mag adds extra bullets, Flared Magwell adds straight stability and Reload Speed or Tactical Mag does both. In the first trait column as the support perk, Feeding Frenzy and Well Rounded are the best of a limited bunch, while in the second slot as the signature perk, Golden Tricorn is much the only choice - a straight 15% damage boost on kills that can be boosted to 50% with an arc ability kill for occasional burst damage against Majors.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 68 https://open.spotify.com/episode/7e93LMhFDUbZZX5SKYzXf0?si=cec8c26785114ffb with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clear in end-game activities. High-Impact Rocket Launchers are meant for add-clear - they have the highest blast radius stat of the subfamilies and do middling damage - 10% less than Adaptives or Aggressives. And saying that, BrayTech Osprey has the worst stats in its subfamily. So, would you really use a rocket launcher for add clear? If the answer is yes not sure it should be, but you go girl/boy/bot/peep, then use the barrel and mag to get to 100 blast radius without hurting velocity, and add Cluster Bombs and Chain Reaction for as much destruction as possible over as wide an area as possible. Recommended MW: Reload Speed or Velocity, with a damage-boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

In the first trait column for the support perk, Threat Detector, Surplus particularly easy to maintain with the extra melee charges from Strand, or Perpetual Motion will bump gunfeel stats up.

// The Messenger PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Flared Magwell, Armor-Piercing Rounds, High-Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Rapid Hit, Perpetual Motion, Kinetic Tremors
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 68 https://open.spotify.com/episode/7e93LMhFDUbZZX5SKYzXf0?si=cec8c26785114ffb with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clear use in end-game activities. The reprised Messenger has a few new tricks for Season 21, which make it worth a look. Good stats across the board, except for recoil direction, which we can help out with Arrowhead Brake in the barrel slot, which takes it to a controllable 90. For the magazine perk, any of the "Rounds" mags or Flared Magwell work well. For your first trait column support perk, Rapid Hit and Perpetual Motion can both layer on addition gunfeel boosts on top. If you're running solo content, don't forget the Alacrity origin trait to pretty much max out every stat on the board, and add 10 Aim Assist too. Finally, in the second slot, the new-for-Lightfall Kinetic Tremors as the signature perk adds bonus AoE damage for 12 hits or four bursts, damaging your target and any adds within 5m. Recommended MW: any will work, depending on your preference, with a damage-boosting Major or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 68 https://open.spotify.com/episode/7e93LMhFDUbZZX5SKYzXf0?si=cec8c26785114ffb with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for chunky add-clear use in endgame activities. The stats on Unexpected Resurgence make it the best adaptive glaive in the sandbox as at Season 21. Every Haft choice involves a trade-off but for most, the improved shield from Auxiliary Reserves, or maybe the range which = projectile speed from Supercooled Accelerator, are worth the penalty to reload speed, which we can get around. In the mag, Appended Mag for the extra shot Extended doesn't do anything more for you, or Accurized Rounds for the range are options, and if reload speed is still a worry, Light Mag or Alloy Mag help out. In the first trait column as the support park, the new-to-Lightfall Replenishing Aegis partially refills the mag on shield damage, and Unstoppable Force as the second column signature perk is a natural pairing, boosting damage by 20% for blocking the same damage with your shield. As an arc speacial weapon, you can also build into blinding and Jolting verbs with an arc subclass, and don't forget the Alacrity origin trait for solo content to pretty much max out range and reload speed, and add 10 Aim Assist too.

@title:Season 20 Guardian Games weapons
@description:Lightfall Guardian Games weapons with Classy Contender origin trait

// The Title PvE first-choice roll
// Full Bore, Ricochet Rounds, Threat Detector, Surrounded
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 61 https://open.spotify.com/episode/35xKd0TwFvvOyymsE9Wp5H with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities. Unfortunately, this doesn't have great stats or any unique perk options by comparison with other aggressive frame SMGs, but drops will rain down during Guardian Games, so that's not unexpected maybe it's just Hakke's unfamiliarity with energy weapons 😉. Season 20 has lost the S-Tier Stats/One for All combination, unfortunately. If you want to tuck one away, push out the range with your barrel and magazine, even at the cost of stability or handling, as we'll be getting that back with the traits, and the Recoil Direction of 85 is pretty much vertical. Full Bore and Ricochet Rounds add a few metres of useful range. In the first trait column as your support perk, if you're not proccing Threat Detector's bonus Stability, Handling and Reload Speed, you're just doing it wrong. Similarly with Surrounded as your second column signature perk - although it's not the Enhanced version, you'll still have 40% bonus damage when procced in CQC. The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful - who would say no to extra class ability energy? Or, if you're up against vehicles and constructs, Hakke Breach Armaments will help burst them down. Recommended MW: Range, Stability or Handling - just go with your preference, with a damage-boosting Minor or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

// Taraxippos PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Fourth Time's The Charm, Outlaw, Hatchling
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 61 https://open.spotify.com/episode/35xKd0TwFvvOyymsE9Wp5H with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for Strand synergy minor add clear in endgame activities. Named after a ghost that frightened horses at a particular spot on the Olympia race course during ancient games there. Our first Lightweight Strand scout rifle has only one direct kinetic slot competitor in Night Watch, and is pretty comparable in stats, although will do 10% less damage, as a non-kinetic weapon. For min-maxxers, the +30 Mobility from the intrinsic perk can help to flesh out builds. Taraxippos is fast-firing, so you will need to tidy up the 54 Recoil Direction. Chambered Compensator or Extended Barrel will get you to a slightly better 64. In the magazine, Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell both offer useful boosts to stability and reload speed and an extra shot for Tac Mag. Fourth Time's The Charm in the first trait column as your support perk is always welcome to extend your mag size, or Outlaw works well for a snappy reload after a crit kill. Then Hatchling in the second column as the signature perk builds into the Strand toolkit - just come to peace that they're likely to be spawned too far away to join you, if you're a Warlock. The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful - who would say no to extra class ability energy? Or, Omolon Fluid Dynamics adds stability and reload speed to the top half of your mag. Recommended MW: Range, Stability or Handling - just go with your preference, with a damage-boosting Minor or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

First-choice PvE roll for Minor add-clear in end-game content. Shapeable. Most Raid weapons boast stellar stat packages, and Rufus's Fury is no different and will be most people's choice for a Strand primary, and will probably only get better when the additional fragments arrive. Although, at 56, the recoil is pretty up-and-down, Arrowhead Brake as the barrel perk takes the Recoil Direction to an even more controllable 86 and adds Handling. Flared Magwell or Ricochet Rounds add Stability and Reload Speed or Range and Stability in the magazine. Rewind Rounds is the best of the support perks in the first trait column for primary weapons, pairing with signature perks like Target Lock, where the refilled magazine allows you to reach the higher damage stacks, for damage against bulkier enemies or Frenzy for a general 15% damage bump. The Harmonic Resonance origin trait can boost damage still further by a stacking 3.33% with one other RoN Raid weapon or 10% with two.

For use against crowds of adds, an overflowed or refilled magazine is a great place to start, so Reconstruction or Rewind Rounds as your first trait column support perk both give you greater uptime for Incandescent's scorch and ignition solar-subclass verbs for crowd control as the second column signature perk. The Harmonic Resonance origin trait can boost damage still further by a stacking 3.33% with one other RoN Raid weapon or 10% with two. Recommended MW: Range, Stability or Handling - just go with your preference, with a damage-boosting Minor or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

// Koraxis's Distress PvE first-choice roll
// Linear Compensator, Quick Launch, Spike Grenades, Chain Reactions, Hatchling
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 57 https://open.spotify.com/episode/3LOWj7jLe0eiacDYwEbK22 with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE roll for Strand subclass synergy for Minor add-clear in end-game content. Most Raid weapons boast excellent stat packages, and Koraxis's Distress is no different. Rapid fire power grenade launchers are more suited to add clear, so to lean into that role, Linear Compensator adds a little extra Blast Radius let's face it, you'll want to catch as many adds as possible in an explosion, or Quick Launch just goes all in for velocity in the barrel. If you do catch a chunkier enemy, Spike Grenades is nice for a little extra impact damage, and then the unique combination of Chain Reaction as your first trait column support perk - let's face it, it's unusual to have it as a support perk - and Hatchling as the signature perk in the second trait column. Chain Reaction kills count towards proccing Hatchling, so you should see plenty of Threadlings spawning. Explosions and a small army of Threadlings together should clear a room pretty fast. The Harmonic Resonance origin trait can boost damage still further by a stacking 3.33% with one other RoN Raid weapon or 10% with two.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 57 https://open.spotify.com/episode/3LOWj7jLe0eiacDYwEbK22 with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE roll for solar synergy in end-game content. The first solar aggressive frame LFR - there's no Veist Stinger origin trait like Fire and Forget has, but Harmonic Resonance can boost damage by 10% so it's still going to be decent for damage. You'll want to be able to control the recoil, so look for stability or recoil direction in a barrel, and Enhanced Battery adds a useful extra shot. Unusually, you can roll Incandescent in the first trait column as your support perk, to synergise with solar subclasses to improve scorch and ignition, and proc Paracausal Affinity in the second column as your signature park. Paracausal Affinity then buffs ignition damage to keep the loop going. The Harmonic Resonance origin trait can boost damage still further by a stacking 3.33% with one other RoN Raid weapon or 10% with two. Recommended MW: Stability - just go with your preference, with a damage-boosting Boss or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod tags:pve, pve-boss, pve-god, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

// Battle Scar PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds, Perpetual Motion, Keep Away, Osmosis
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for Minor add-clear in end-game content. Not a lot of current competition for lightweight pulse rifles as at v7.0.0.7, anyway but they add a very useful +20 mobility useful when buildcrafting and +6.25% movement speed. Unfortunately, the stats on the reprised Battle Scar are low across the board - the New Devrim Kay VIII Foundry Field Tested origin perk should help, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers five stacks would take 1001 hits to achieve!. You'd really be looking for Arrowhead Brake in the barrel ideally, to help clean up the low recoil direction and, if you prefer stability and reload speed go for Tactical Mag, or for range go for Accurized Rounds. To improve your gunfeel, in the first trait slot as you r support perk, Perpetual Motion adds a decent bump to handling, stability and reload speed, or if you want extra range then Keep Away boosts that, reload speed and accuracy. Osmosis, as your signature perk in the second trait column is fairly rare and will pick up any of the energy synergies from your subclass say, volatile rounds when that's procced by a void ability - if you haven't already got a pulse rifle with the perk, then this would be worth hanging on to. Recommended MW: TBH anything will work - just go with your preferece, with a damage-boosting Minor, Taken Spec mod tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for void synergy and Minor add clear in end-game content. The reprised Harsh Language is only the second void wave-frame grenade launcher. Lower stats that Deafening Whisper although the range of stats is pretty compressed - the New Devrim Kay VIII Foundry Field Tested origin perk should help, but it takes a long time to proc the higher tiers. You start out with 100 blast radius - not that it makes any difference as it's the dump stat for wave frame GLs - so you can use the barrel and mag perks for velocity and handling. Quick Launch is ideal, and Smart Drift Control works as a good alternate, and out of the two choices, High-Velocity Rounds is the mag perk to choose. the standout support perk in the first trait column is Envious Assassin - you can get up to three shots in the barrel for killing adds with your primary or power weapon. You have a choice of two signature perks in the second trait column to help with add clear - Destabilising Rounds is the more offensive option for add clear or Repulsor Brace for tanking damage in a crowd.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for stasis synergy and Minor add-clear in general content. The Season 20 Omolon weapon named after Celtic godess worshipped in Roman Britain, if you're asking is an Adaptive Stasis Sidearm. First thing to say is that, if you already have a decent stasis sidearm, this really doesn't offer anything much new so you can probably give it a miss. For newer Guardians, controlling the recoil on sidearms, through recoil direction and stability, is the job of your barrel and mag although additional reload speed for the Senuna is also useful. If you're a serial reloaded, the Omolon origin trait will help with both in the top half of the magazine. Arrowhead Brake as your barrel perk brings the Recoil Direction to 100 and adds handling to make the gun feel snappier. In the mag, Flared Magwell or maybe Appended Mag are probably the best picks - Light Mag isn't bad either. Feeding Frenzy as your support perk in the first trait column will speed up reloads still further after kills, while Headstone as your signature perk in the second trait column generates your Stasis crystal on a crit kill to use your subclass fragments with.

// Irukandji PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Polygonal Rifling, Steady Rounds, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Envious Assassing, Fourth Time's The Charm, Rapid Hit, Firing Line, Focused Fury
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for Major and Boss damage in a fireteam in end-game content. The Season 20 Veist weapon is a rapid-fire sniper rifle with as-expected lowish stats, as a World drop weapon. Irukandji a small, rare, highly venomous jellyfish from Australia, because of course it would be does benefit from the Veist Stinger origin trait which is occasionally useful even in its nerfed state. Remember that as at Season 20, this will do less base damage than an equivalent kinetic weapon so, to be competitive, you'll need the parks to fall your way. The main issue you'll find is with keeping the reticule on a boss's crit spot - you'll need to boost Recoil Direction and Stability to make this easier, so Arrowhead Brake or Polygonal Rifling are your barrel perk choices, and Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag or even Steady Rounds you're not likely to be outside of the damage falloff distance, even with the range penalty should be your mag perk options. As your first trait column support perk, Envious Assassin overflows your magazine passively with primary and power weapon kills, Fourth Time's The Charm works extends the magazine if you hit crits consistently, or Rapid Hit improves stability and reload speed as you fire to keep your reticule steadier. In the signature perk, second column trait, Firing Line is more forgiving of an occasional missed shot when you're in a fireteam but, if you're flying solo, Focused Fury will boost damage in the bottom half of your magazine if you can hit your crits consistently.

// Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control, Augmented Drum, Field Prep, Explosive Light
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 56 https://open.spotify.com/episode/6hjWp0NaachsNymnN22FDL with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE roll for Major and Boss damage in end-game content. Shapeable. The Hakke foundry for Season 20 is Marsilion-C named after the King of Muslim Spain in the late 700s CE, if you're asking, a rapid-fire, solar power grenade launcher with decent stats and which is very usable if you don't already have existing options. For major or boss damage, if you look build into Explosive Light as your signature perk in the second trait column then, as your blast radius is already set to 100, you can concentrate on Velocity in your Barrel - Quick Launch or Smart Drift Control. With 100 Blast Radius, Spike Grenades will be much less effective, so Augmented Drum is the better mag perk, as this synergises with Field Prep as your support perk in the first trait column, for more ammo reserves and faster reloads. The Enhanced Explosive Light perk grants an extra stack of damage over the standard version, so you'll have a magazine capable of using all seven stacks before reloading! Recommended MW: Velocity, with a damage-boosting Major, Boss or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod tags:pve, pve-boss, pve-god, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

@title:Season of Defiance weapons
@description:Season 20 weapons wit the Noble Deeds origin trait

// Perpetualis PvE first-choice roll
// Extended Barrel, Smallbore, Tactical Mag, Keep Away, Zen Moment, Golden Tricorn
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 55 https://open.spotify.com/show/36OTFinErCUBrCzu6BaYbo with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for add clear in end-game activities. Shapeable. This is the easier to get Strand adaptive auto-rifle for Season of Defiance, if you're unable to get into the Root of Nightmares Raid. The stats are decent, although both stability and handling are a little below par, and the recoil direction could maybe do with a little help, although the Noble Deeds origin perk can help out with the handling and boost reload speed too. Extended Barrel or Smallbore are your best barrel choices, and Tactical Mag is the best of the mag perks. In the first trait column, there aren't many support perks that help in PvE - Keep Away is the pick of a limited budget, or possibly the reworked Zen Moment. For your second trait column signature perk, Golden Tricorn is unique as at v7.0.0.6, anyway on a Strand auto rifle and the second stack isn't too difficult to proc by either using a grapple melee or shooting a Tangle, for a massive 50% damage boost for 10s. Recommended MW: Range or Stability, with a damage-boosting Minor or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, controller, mkb

// Raconteur PvE first-choice roll
// Elastic String, Compact Arrow Shaft, Archer's Tempo, Explosive Head
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 55 https://open.spotify.com/show/36OTFinErCUBrCzu6BaYbo with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for end-game activities. Shapeable. Our first Stasis Precision Bow, with competitive stats by comparison with the other kinetic slot options, although Accuracy is the lowest of all the Precisions. Your aim with the Bowstring and Arrow, as ever, is to reduce the draw time, while not harming your accuracy or handling. Elastic String is the best for as low a draw time as possible and helps Handling too, at the cost of Accuracy, which you can recover with an Accuracy Masterwork, while Compact Arrow Shaft boosts handling and reload speed. Don't forget, the Noble Deeds origin perk will also boost both as well. If you ever see Archer's Tempo as the support perk in the first trait column then you don't need to look much further. Similarly, Explosive Head adds damage and flinch for free so is the best signature perk in the second trait column. Recommended MW: Accuracy or Draw Time, with a damage-boosting Minor or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, controller, mkb

// Royal Executioner PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Accelerated Coils, Envious Assassin, Threat Detector, Lead from Gold, Incandescent
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 55 https://open.spotify.com/show/36OTFinErCUBrCzu6BaYbo with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for Solar synergy in end-game activities. Shapeable. Season 20's solar adaptive fusion rifle has okayish stats, with the Noble Deeds origin perk helping with a boost to handling and reload speed when procced. Arrowhead Brake as the barrel perk makes the recoil much easier to control, taking the Recoil Direction from 58 to 88. Particle Repeater is an option, but Accelerated Coils is the better play - you'll be killing red bars even with the slight reduction in damage and you'll appreciate the faster charge time. The Noble Deeds origin trait helps with Handling, for more snappiness and Reload Speed, so fits in really well. Envious Assassin is a stand out support perk in the first trait column, overflowing the magazine as you get primary and power weapon kills, but Threat Detector and Lead From Gold are right up there too. This is the first solar FR to give the option of Incandescent as the signature perk in the second column, which plays into the subclass verbs for end-game add clear. Recommended MW: Charge Time, with a damage-boosting Major or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

// Prodigal Return PvE first-choice roll
// Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control, Disorienting Grenades, Envious Assassin, Disruption Break
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 55 https://open.spotify.com/show/36OTFinErCUBrCzu6BaYbo with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for add suppression in end-game activities. Shapeable. This drops into a very competitive field of arc lightweight grenade launchers, although it does have decent stats except for handling. The usual play is to look for velocity, to get the grenade to its target as fast as possible, and handling, for speedy swaps, and it'll be no different this time. Fortunately, the Noble Deeds origin trait helps with Handling and Reload Speed, so fits in really well. Quick Launch is the best barrel, but Smart Drift Control isn't far behind. For add control, Disorienting Grenades give you breathing space in a firefight. Pair that with Envious Assassin, which can give you up to three in the barrel! as your support perk in the first trait column, and Disruption Break, for 50% bonus kinetic damage to burst down chunkier red bar Minors and the occasional Major while they stumble around as the signature perk, and you probably have the perfect add control breach-loading GL. Recommended MW: Velocity, with a Quick Access Sling for faster swaps or Backup Mag mod tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

// Prodigal Return PvE first-choice roll
// Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control, High-Velocity Rounds, Threadt Detector, Field Prep, Voltshot
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 55 https://open.spotify.com/show/36OTFinErCUBrCzu6BaYbo with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for Arc Synergy in general activities. Shapeable. This drops into a very competitive field of arc lightweight grenade launchers, although it does have decent stats except for handling. The usual play is to look for velocity, to get the grenade to its target as fast as possible, and handling, for speedy swaps, and it'll be no different this time. Fortunately, the Noble Deeds origin trait helps with Handling and Reload Speed, so fits in really well. Quick Launch is the best barrel, but Smart Drift Control isn't far behind. With one eye towards building a weapon around Voltshot this is the first GL with Voltshot as an option, although the jury is still out on whether that's a good idea or not as the signature perk in the second trait column, we'll need to make the reload as fast as possible. High Velocity Rounds boosts reload speed as well as velocity. Then Threat Detector or Field Prep as your support perk in the first trait column helps too. Using Spark of Beacons gives you arc Blinding on a kill, which should make the follow-up shot after a kill, to get your Jolt damage tick, easier to hit. Recommended MW: Reload Speed, with a damage-boosting Major or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod tags:pve, pve-major, pve-god, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

// Regnant PvE first-choice roll
// Quick Launch, Smart Drift Control, Spike Grenades, Auto-Loading Holster, Explosive Light
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 55 https://open.spotify.com/show/36OTFinErCUBrCzu6BaYbo with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for sustained boss DPS in end-game activities. Shapeable. Essentially a void Wendigo with poorer stats, but with access to enhanced traits. As is usual for grenade launchers, look to increase velocity to get the grenade on target as fast as possible, and handling, for general snappiness. Quick Launch is the best barrel, but Smart Drift Control isn't far behind. The Noble Deeds origin trait helps with handling, and reload speed too, so works well. In the magazine, Spike Grenade adds direct impact damage to a target. In the first trait column as your pick of the support perks, Auto-Loading Holster lets you empty the magazine and reload while you're swapped to your DPS special weapon to rinse and repeat, while Explosive Light is by far the best damage boost for your signature perk in the second - and the enhanced version adds an extra stack on top. Recommended MW: Handling, with a damage-boosting Boss or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod tags:pve, pve-boss, pve-god, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 55 https://open.spotify.com/show/36OTFinErCUBrCzu6BaYbo with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for burst DPS against majors in end-game activities. Shapeable. Essentially a void Wendigo with poorer stats, but with access to enhanced traits. As is usual for grenade launchers, look to increase velocity to get the grenade on target as fast as possible, and handling, for general snappiness. Quick Launch is the best barrel, but Smart Drift Control isn't far behind. The Noble Deeds origin trait helps with handling, and reload speed too, so works well. In the magazine, Spike Grenade adds direct impact damage to a target.

// Regnant PvE first-choice roll
// Volatile Launch, Linear Compensator, High-Explosive Ordnance, Repulsor Brace, Destabilizing Rounds
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 55 https://open.spotify.com/show/36OTFinErCUBrCzu6BaYbo with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for void synergy. Shapeable. Essentially a void Wendigo with poorer stats, but with access to enhanced traits. You'll be using this roll for add clearing, so you'll want to crank up the blast radius with your barrel with Volatile Launch, High Explosive Ordnance in the magazine, and a Blast Radious Masterwork. Repulsor Brace as your support perk in the first trait column gives you a void overshield for void-debuffed kills, which is exactly what Destabilizing Rounds sets you up for, as your signature perk in the second trait column, making targets near a kill volatile, including chunkier ones for easier clean-up with the next shot. This combination should make you a bit of a walking tank in add-dense areas, as long as you have ammo. Recommended MW: Blast Radius, with a damage-boosting Major or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

// Caretaker PvE first-choice roll
// Jagged Edge, Swordmaster's Guard, Tireless Blade, Relentless Strikes, Incandescent
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 55 https://open.spotify.com/show/36OTFinErCUBrCzu6BaYbo with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for solar synergy and minor add clearing in end-game content. Shapeable. This is maybe our first non-Raid sword with significantly different stats - the Charge Rate is 60, by comparison with every other adaptive sword's 20 except DSC's Bequest, and the Noble Deeds origin perk boosts the charge rate further for buffing Guardians around you. As with most swords, go for as much impact damage as possible, so Jagged Edge as your blade plus the inevitable Impact Masterwork. Swordmaster's Guard is a reliable guard perk to have your heavy attack available quickly. For your support perk in the first trait column, both Tireless Blade and Relentless Strikes work but, once you get Incandescent working and Ember of Ashes helps as your signature perk in the second trait column, the ignite kills among adds count towards Tireless Blade kills, so that will be the more efficient way to regain ammo. Recommended MW: Impact, with a damage-boosting Minor or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

// Synchronic Roulette PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, High-Caliber Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Flared Magwell, Pulse Monitor, Target Lock
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast Versus Enemies episode 54 with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr https://open.spotify.com/episode/3obSAgsEW0RBeSjYXOVcgN?si=95ac723a75f749c3. First-choice PvE roll for end-game content. Precision frame SMG, so you don't have to worry about recoil direction and range is pretty compressed, so go for handling and stability with your barrel. In the mag, High-Caliber Rounds is always good for extra flinch on a bullet hose, but Armor-Piercing is also decent for damaging multiple adds in CQC, Ricochet Rounds can be run or just get extra stability and Reload speed with Flared Magwell. There's not much PvE-wise in the first trait column but Pulse Monitor could be useful if you're out of cover to use Target Lock and are taking damage, to reload you magazine to keep your damage output up, and the Nanotech Tracer Rockets add both damage and flinch when you proc them - really fun for PvE.

First-choice PvE roll for void synergy. We've seen rapid-fire shotguns a lot - maybe not the play for end-game activities where you're probably in trouble if you're close enough to use it, but useful for bursting down a major or champion once stunned. The ranges on shotguns are compressed, to look for a handling or stability barrel, and Tactical Mag is easily the best of the mag perks. Envious Assassin should provide an easy route to an overfilled magazine but as alternatives, Lead from Gold and Perpetual Motion are decent too. In the last column, Destabilizing Rounds spreads volatility to surrounding adds on a kill to synergise with Void subclass verbs. On top, the Nanotech Tracer Rockets add both damage and flinch when you proc them - really fun for PvE.

Envious Assassin should provide an easy route to an overfilled magazine but as alternatives, Lead from Gold and Perpetual Motion are decent too.

// Basso Ostinato PvE first-choice roll
// Full Choke, Tactical Mag, Envious Assassin, Lead from Gold, Perpetual Motion, One-Two Punch

First-choice PvE roll for burst damage. We've seen rapid-fire shotguns a lot - you'll need to be careful to to be in a vulnerable position when using one, but they're useful for bursting down a major or champion once stunned. With one eye on One-Two Punch in the second trait column, Full Choke gives you the best chance of hitting your target with every pellet, and Tactical Mag is easily the best of the mag perks. Envious Assassin should provide an easy route to an overfilled magazine but as alternatives, Lead from Gold and Perpetual Motion are decent too, and One-Two Punch adds additional multiplicative melee damage even if it's been nerfed somewhat to burst down a major, or even a boss. On top, the Nanotech Tracer Rockets add both damage and flinch when you proc them - really fun for PvE although you'll probably not be seeing them often on a Boss-damaging weapon.

// Iterative Loop PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Particle Repeater, Accelerated Coils, Compulsive Reloader, Voltshot
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast Versus Enemies episode 54 with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr https://open.spotify.com/episode/3obSAgsEW0RBeSjYXOVcgN?si=95ac723a75f749c3. First-choice PvE roll for Arc synergy and burst damage. Seeing as fusion rifles apply the highest Jolt tick damage of any special weapon, it would be rude not to pick or shape a roll. Rapid fire fusions need a fair bit of control with nine bolts being fired, so Arrowhead Break takes the recoil direction to 77, or up the stability through Fluted Barrel or Polygonal Rifling. In the battery, there's nothing to help speed up reloading, so Particle Repeater adds more stability, or Accelerated Coils speeds up charge time. Compulsive Reloader and a Reload Speed Masterwork boosts reload to 100 at the top half of the mag, so your reloads after a kill to proc Voltshot should be as snappy as it's possible to get. On top, the Nanotech Tracer Rockets add both damage and flinch when you proc them with rapid kills - really fun for PvE.

First-choice PvE roll for burst damage in end-game activities. Sniper rifles are in a bit of a tough spot as v7.0.0.3, but it's worth holding on to a good roll or two in the Vault, just in case. If you're shaping one, Fluted Barrel makes it snappier, and you can bypass the reload speed penalty of Extended Barrel with Backup Mag and Envious Assassin, to overload your magazine of 5 to 8. In the second trait column, Explosive Payload adds a flat 15% bonus damage or, in a fireteam, Firing Line adds 20% crit damage. On top, the Nanotech Tracer Rockets add both damage and flinch when you proc them with multiple hits - really fun for PvE.

First-choice PvE roll for stasis synergy and end-game content. The first kinetic slot high-impact fusion rifle - it needs handling and stability to improve gunfeel, but it might be worth hanging onto in case the archetype gets a little love. Fusion Rifle range is very constrained, so look for handling with your barrel, and Ionized or Enhanced Battery adds extra shots. If you spray with your first shot, then the SOFA Stats/One For All roll will more than offset any reload penalty, along with other gunfeel boosts, as well as increasing damage by a chunky 35%. The Omolon origin trait is useful in the top half of the mag, to help with reloads and a touch of extra stability too.

Reconstruction, Subsistence or Slideways all help you keep your magazine topped up so you can take advantage of the damage boost from Golden Tricorn.

// Lodbrok-C PvE first-choice roll
// Smallbore, Extended Mag, Appended Mag, Fourth Time's The Charm, Target Lock
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast Versus Enemies episode 51 with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects https://open.spotify.com/episode/5BpRdHN5pWyyKNLGsLB1Qh?si=4b9f4a74bf194ff2. First-choice PvE roll for end-game content. Pretty decent, in-bands stats, so Smallbore offers a little extra range and stability, both of which are useful boosts. To take full advantage of Target Lock, to burst down beefier minors, look for as large a magazine as you can and combine with Fourth Time's the Charm. This could be a little niche, but this roll with Lodbrok could be a useful tool to have in your loadout if you're facing constructs and vehicles, with the Hakke Breach Armaments' 15% damage boost on top of Target Lock.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. First-choice PvE roll for general content. Shapeable. The Ambush origin trait is probably more for PvP than PvE, with the extra range, handling and 10% boost to damage for a few moments after combat starts but will be more use for a glaive than Hakke Breach Armaments. JoK is a new subtype for Season 19 - a slower, but harder hitting slashy shooty stick than we're used to. You're going to be in CQC, where projectile speed governed by range isn't quite as important, so the shield can be quite useful to survive in a crowd. Use your haft to improve charge time and shield duration, and take the extra shot from Appended Mag Extended Mag gives you no more shots so isn't worth it. In the first trait column, Overflow on a Special or Power weapon is just so good - more than double your magazine size and it bypasses the low reload speed just for picking up a brick! Close to Melee was just built for glaives - projectile kills improve melee damage by 30%, and more kills with either projectile or melee extend the timer. Proc and go have fun.

// Retrofit Escapade PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Tactical Mag, Stats for All, Field Prep, Feeding Frenzy, Frenzy
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. Backup PvE roll for end-game content. Shapeable. The Ambush origin trait is probably more for PvP than PvE, with the extra range, handling and 10% boost to damage for a few moments after combat starts, although Suros Synergy's flinch reduction in reload is useful in a firefight too so take your pick. This is better in every stat than the only other rapid fire LMG - Shattered Cypher - and there are a few ways you can go with a weapon build. You'll need to control your fire with short bursts - so, to make it easier, tighten up the recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake, or boost stability with your barrel perk. Add your choice of extra shots, stability and reload speed with the mag. For end-game add clear, use Stats for All, Field Prep, or Feeding Frenzy for maximum uptime in your first trait column, and the reliable Frenzy in the second for an easy to use 15% damage boost. Recommended  MW: Stability or Reload Speed, with a damage-boosting Minor, Major or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

// Fire and Forget PvE first-choice roll
Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Enhanced Battery, Field Prep, Focused Fury
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. First-choice PvE roll for end-game boss DPS. Shapeable. Veist Stinger is the origin trait to use, as it procs per shot rather than per burst, which means you'll probably never need to reload. F&F is a non-endgame obtainable  boss-killing replacement for Reed's Regret, and a aggressive-frame companion to Stormchaser. Being a stasis LFR, it's easy to get a Font of Might 25% boost to your damage if you have a Warlock putting down a Well and willing to use the Supreme Wellmaker mod, and you're using the Elemental Shards and Elemental Time Dilation mods. You'll need to keep your shots on a boss's crit spot, so maximise your stability with your barrel, and then add in an extra charge with no downsides with Enhanced Battery. For boss damage, use Field Prep to boost your ammo reserves which you'll be calling on with Veist Stinger, and you'll get plenty of opportunity to proc the 20% damage boost from Focused Fury once you hit six individual crits the trait procs on individual shots rather than on bursts.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. First-choice PvE roll for end-game add clear. Shapeable. The Rasputin's Arsenal origin trait reloads on a shield break, which should save on a few reloads. Precisions aren't the strongest choice for PvE as at Season 19 v6.3.0.2, and the Ikelos HC's stats are pretty bad across the board, but there are a few combinations that are still interesting. Fill in some of the stat gaps in Handling and Range with your barrel, and then with the combined goodness of Armor-Piercing, High-Caliber and Ricochet Rounds, Seraph Rounds is a clear first choice in the mag. Even though you're using about 25% of your magazine to proc SOFA Stats/One for All, the stat boosts to round everything out and 35% damage boost are well worth it for add-clear.

title:Season 19 Dawning weapons
description:New and reprised Dawning weapons with the Dawning Surprise origin perk

// Cold Front PvE first-choice roll
// Polygonal Rifling, Fluted Barrel, Smallbore, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Stats for All, One for All
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. PvE first-choice roll for end-game Minor clearing. The only easily available Aggressive SMG in the game other than Xur selling an Extraordinary Rendition - you have a good one, you probably won't need a Cold Front. Option of Hakke Breach Armaments or the Dawning Surprise origin trait can help you gain ability energy and restart healing by collecting a small box after killing a half-dozen enemies or so. Very poor stability, so for controller Polygonal Rifling, Fluted Barrel or Smallbore is a must, together with Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell to get it as high as possible. For end-game add clear, the reliable SOFA combination of Stats for All and One for All rounds out the stats and adds 35% bonus damage just for hitting three different enemies. Recommended MW: Stability, with a damage-boosting Major or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-god, pve-minor, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

// Stay Frosty PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Thresh, Adaptive Munitions
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. PvE first-choice roll for end-game match game activities and anti-Barrier Champions when the mod's around. Option of Omolon Fluid Dynamics or the Dawning Surprise origin trait can help you gain ability energy and restart healing by collecting a small box after killing a half-dozen enemies or so. This is the first Stasis Lightweight frame Pulse Rifle, the frame providing +20 mobility and 6.25% boost to movement, and the first to roll with Adaptive Munitions to provide a shield-busting primary in the kinetic slot. Has decent stats compared to kinetic Lightweights. Sort out the wonky recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake. To maximise damage against shields, look for Armor-Piercing Rounds and, in the absence of a complementary column 1 trait, Thresh provides a nice little boost to super regeneration. But the real gold is Adaptive Munitions in trait column 2 for primary ammo shield busting in the kinetic slot for the first time. Recommended MW: Stability or Range, with a damage-boosting Minor, Major or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

// Glacioclasm PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Smallbore, Particle Repeater, Accelerated Coils, Subsistence, Slideshot, Reservoir Burst
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. PvE first-choice roll for crowd clearing. Option of Omolon Fluid Dynamics for the faster top-up reloads or the Dawning Surprise origin trait which helps you gain ability energy and restart healing by collecting a small box after killing a half-dozen enemies or so. There are no real holes in the stats, but Fluted Barrel or Smallbore provide nice boosts in the barrel. In the battery, Particle Repeater helps keep the burst tight, or if you're a little impatient, Accelerated Coils reduces charge time. The big draw here is Reservoir Burst with either Subsistence or Slideshot to keep the magazine full. Recommended MW: Reload Speed or Charge Time, with a damage-boosting Minor, Major or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, controller, mkb

// Glacioclasm PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Smallbore, Enhanced Battery, Particle Repeater, Accelerated Coils, Repulsor Brace, Golden Tricorn
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. PvE first-choice roll for Void subclass in endgame content. Option of Omolon Fluid Dynamics or the Dawning Surprise origin trait can help you gain ability energy and restart healing by collecting a small box after killing a half-dozen enemies or so. There are no real holes in the stats, but Fluted Barrel or Smallbore provide nice boosts in the barrel. In the battery, Enhanced Battery gets you more shots, Particle Repeater helps keep the burst tight, or if you're a little impatient, Accelerated Coils reduces charge time. For Void subclasses, Repulsor Brace works with your void debuffs to give you a damage resistant overshield and the second stack of Golden Tricorn should be easy to proc with the melee and grenade toolkit.

// Avalanche PvE first-choice roll
Arrowhead Brake. Fluted Barrel, Extended Mag, Appended Mag, Ambitious Assassin, Incandescent, Adrenaline Junkie, Swashbuckler
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. PvE first-choice roll for chunkier Minors with a Solar subclass in endgame content. Option of Suros Synergy or the Dawning Surprise origin trait which can help you gain ability energy and restart healing by collecting a small box after killing a half-dozen enemies or so. Balanced stats, so you can use Arrowhead Brake to get straight recoil, or Fluted Barrel for extra Handling and Stability. In the mag slot, we'll be wanting to take full advantage of Ambitious Assassin's 110% bonus mag size per rapid kill after reloading  with a size-boosting option. Then take your pick of damage-boosting magazine traits against Minors or Majors to make the most of a huge magazine. Recommended MW: Stability, with a damage-boosting Minor, Major or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, controller, mkb

// Zephyr PvE first-choice roll
// Jagged Edge, Tempered Edge, Swordmaster's Guard, Relentless Strike, Unrelenting, Cold Steel
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. PvE first-choice roll for Stasis subclass synergy. No second origin trait, but Dawning Surprise helps you gain ability energy and restart healing by collecting a small box after killing a half-dozen enemies or so - ideal in keeping you alive in CQC. In the blade slot, Jagged Edge to maximises damage or Tempered Edge balances a bit of extra damage and ammo, for all-round utility. Swordmaster's Guard is the usual recommendation in the guard slot, to get your heavy attack up as quickly as possible. Cold Steel is Zephyr's signature trait - ideal for synergising with Stasis subclasses by adding slow stacks and freezing opponents. Relentless Strikes works well against both groups of adds or a single target, or Unrelenting works for add-clear, recovering your health from both the perk itself and the origin trait.

// Mechabre PvE first-choice roll

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 37. PvE first-choice roll for sustained damage against Bosses. The Origin Trait, gaining better ADS and strafe speed when on your own, might be useful when you're away from your fireteam, but think of it more as a useful added extra when it's procced. Direct competitor to Occluded Finality, but with a much more reasonable 45 Zoom. You don't really need to worry about range, so look no further than Fluted Barrel to boost Handling and Stability. You want to go all in to the magazine size, so use Extended Barrel and Backup Mag to get to five in the mag. In the first trait column, Clown Cartridge boosts magazine size by up to three on reload or Triple Tap gets you seven crit shots without reloading. In the second column, Vorpal Weapon adds 15% damage against Majors, Bosses and vehicles or High-Impact Reserves will add up to 25% bonus damage once you get past the second bullet.

The Origin Trait, gaining better ADS and strafe speed when on your own, might be useful when you're away from your fireteam, but think of it more as a useful added extra when it's procced. Excellent, pretty much best-in-class stats, and the precision frame means you don't really have to worry about Recoil Direction, so boost your gunfeel stats with your barrel and mag. You can turn this into a Legendary mini-Monte Carlo with Pugilist in the first trait column and pair this with Osmosis in the second for an additional primary energy weapon option when you use your grenade - useful as a utility roll, and for soloing activities in particular. This won't replace a Demolitionist/Osmosis The Last Breath, and you only really need one Osmosis auto rifle in your Vault, but you never know - Bungie might just add melee kills to proc...

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 37. PvE first-choice roll for Barrier Champions and match game endgame content. The Origin Trait, gaining better ADS and strafe speed when on your own, might be useful when you're away from your fireteam, but think of it more as a useful added extra when it's procced. Dreadful stats compared to any other energy rapid-fire pulse rifle as at v6.2.5.1, but it's the only solar one currently available. Wonky recoil direction of 50, so you'll need to straighten that out as much as possible with a Recoil Direction barrel, Stability Barrel or a bit of both. Armor-Piercing Rounds adds 5% damage to shields in your mag slot. Perpetual Motion boosts gunfeel stats passively and, if you don't already have a better solar pulse rifle with Adaptive Munitions, then you should always have one in your vault to both deal with Barrier Champions, when the mod's around, or for dealing with shields in match game activities.

The Bray Inheritance trait is really useful for PvE, returning from 0.46% to 2% ability energy from hits the amount depends on the weapon archetype. Good stats by comparison with other rapid-fire scouts, and there are a couple of ways to go with your roll. The first thing to do is sort out the recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake, which also helps handling a bit. Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell add stability and reload speed and an extra bullet for Tac Mag. Rapid Hit or Perpetual Motion layers more stability and reload speed - stability is good to help stay on a crit spot. Incandescent is great for add clear and hits your solar verbs.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast Versus Enemies episode 48 with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for end-game activities. The Bray Inheritance trait is really useful for PvE, returning from 0.46% to 2% ability energy from hits the amount depends on the weapon archetype. Pretty much best in-subfamily stats, but any kinetic sniper has to offer a lot to stand out from the crowd. If you decide this is for you, the best rolls are more for burst damage against majors and stunned Champions. Fluted Barrel adds handling and stability, or go all-in to stability with Polygonal Rifling. You can use Tactical Mag to add stability and reload speed, Alloy Mag to help with reloads on an empty mag, or maximise your magazine size with Extended Mag. For Majors, Reconstruction will double your magazine size so you can get up to 10 in the mag with Extended Mag and a Backup Mag mod. If you're in a group, Firing Line provides a passive 20% bonus crit damage in a fireteam or, if you're running solo, Focused Fury can proc after three crit his, so your remaining shots have 20% bonus damage.

// Heritage PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Smallbore, Assault Mag, Tactical Mag, Reconstruction, Focused Fury
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast Versus Enemies episode 48 with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for Majors in end-game activities. The Bray Inheritance trait is really useful for PvE, returning from 0.46% to 2% ability energy from hits the amount depends on the weapon archetype. Great kinetic slug shotgun - good stats across the board. While they're no longer the pillar for majors and boss damage they once were, they still work well as a weapon to swap to for burst or sustained damage. Fluted Barrel or Smallbore are your barrel choices for extra stability with a side order of handling or range depending on your preference. Assault Mag's increased fire rate is effectively a 7.7% boost to DPS, or Tactical Mag lets you get to the maximum of 8 in the mag with a Backup Mag mod. Reconstruction overfills your magazine to double size which means you only need to hit three or four crits, depending on how close you get to the magazine limit, for 11s 12s with the Enhanced Perk for a 20% damage boost for the remainder of the magazine with Focused Fury.

While they're no longer the pillar for majors and boss damage they once were, they still work well as a weapon to swap to for burst or sustained damage. Fluted Barrel or Smallbore are your barrel choices for extra stability with a side order of handling or range depending on your preference. Assault Mag's increased fire rate is effectively a 7.7% boost to DPS, or Tactical Mag lets you get to the maximum of 8 in the mag with a Backup Mag mod. or melee builds, Pugilist and Swashbuckler are the natural choice - get a melee kill for a refreshable 33% damage boost, and then each hit regenerates a little melee energy from the origin trait, while each kill regenerates a full 20%. Recommended MW: Handling or Range, with a Backup Mag, or damage-boosting Major, Boss or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-boss, pve-major, pve-god, controller, mkb

// Commemoration PvE first-choice roll
// // Arrowhead Brake, Chambered Compensator, Extended Barrel, Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Extended Mag, Flared Magwell, Alloy Mag, Reconstruction, Fourth Time's the Charm, Firing Line
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast Versus Enemies episode 48 with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for burst or sustained majors or boss damage in end-game activities. The Bray Inheritance trait is really useful for PvE, returning from 0.46% to 2% ability energy from hits the amount depends on the weapon archetype. Good stats and a stellar PvE perk pool make this an LMG worth chasing. You can choose to sort the recoil with Arrowhead Brake, Chambered Compensator or Extended Barrel, or improve stability with Fluted Barrel or Polygonal Rifling. Most mag choices could have a role - boost your magazine size with Appended or Extended Mag, reload speed with Flared Magwell or Alloy Mag, or both with Tactical Mag. If you're focusing on one target for damage, Reconstruction overflows your mag to doble size, or Fourth Time's the Charm can keep you topped up against a big boss crit, while Firing Line boosts damage by 20% when you're in a fireteam. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Backup Mag, or damage-boosting Major, Boss or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-boss, pve-major, pve-god, controller, mkb

// Bequest PvE first-choice roll
// Jagged Edge, Swordmaster's Guard, Relentless Strikes, Surrounded
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast Versus Enemies episode 48 with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for major or boss damage in end-game activities. The Bray Inheritance trait is really useful for PvE, returning from 0.46% to 2% ability energy from hits the amount depends on the weapon archetype. The standout stat here is impact, which is 10 points higher than for any other adaptive sword, which makes it competitive in end-game content for chunkier adds. Jagged Edge adds more damage and Swordmaster's Guard increases you heavy attack charge rate. For major or boss damage in a crowd - think Duality - Relentless Strikes returns ammo for every three hits, and Surrounded boosts damage by 36.5% 47% for the Enhanced Park.

// Midha's Reckoning PvP first-choice roll
// Hammer-Forged Rifling, Extended Barrel, Full Bore, Projection Fuse, Accelerated Coils, Backup Plan, Successful Warm-Up
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 277 with @illPhysics and thanks to @Legoleflash. First-choice PvP pick - one of those rare weapons that works for both duelling and kill-chaining. Shapeable. Definitely not meta out of the box as at v6.2.0.7 with a base TTK of 1.09s with four bolts, but there's a perk combination that helps with that. Most stats are okayish, with Aim Assistance a standout highest in class - add in some targeting mods on the weapon and helmet if you want to build into this weapon. You're only firing five bolts, so you can spec into range with your barrel, as controlling the recoil should be easier. With the battery perk, you might be tempted by Accelerated Coils for an even faster charge time, but you'll probably get more use from Projection Fuse's extra range for consistency. The real fun is in the two trait columns - Backup Plan gets you to 100 Handling on swapping, and brings the TTK for your first shot down to 0.81s. After your first kill, Successful Warm-Up kicks into reduce it still further to 0.73s. You still need to hit 4 out of 5 bolts, but the targeting mods make that much easier to achieve, and the TTK is faster than an out-of-the-box Rapid Fire Fusion Rifle.

// Yesteryear PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Chambered Compensator, Extended Barrel, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Armor-Piercing Rounds, High-Calibre Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Flared Magwell, Light Mag, Appended Mag, Outlaw, Desperado
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for general content. Drops from Gambit activities, so reset your reputation as many times as you have patience for first, to maximise the trait options from decrypting engrams. Awful Recoil Direction stat, so a barrel that helps can be useful, or add Stability to reduce its effect. In the mag slot, you can go with pretty much anything except Alloy Mag or Extended Mag, depending on your preference. This is the first Pulse Rifle that's not a High Impact frame that can roll with Desperado - pair it with Outlaw to keep the bullets coming. Recommended MW: Stability or Handling, with a Counterbalance mod or, if can manage without, a damage-boosting Minor, Major or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, controller, mkb

// Out of Bounds PvE first-choice roll
// Polygonal Rifling, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, High-Calibre Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Threat Detector, Surrounded
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Drops from Crucible activities, so reset your reputation as many times as you have patience for first, to maximise the trait options from decrypting engrams. Stability is helpful with the bullet output, but a little extra Range or Handling is useful too. For end-game content, and you're likely to be in CQC, so Threat Detector and Surrounded boost gunfeel stats and Surrounded provides a hefty 46% damage boots with the spec mod once that's rolled in to the perk by Bungie, go for a damage-boosting mod or Backup Mag. Recommended MW: Stability or Handling, with a Surrounded Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, pve-god, controller, mkb

Drops from Crucible activities, so reset your reputation as many times as you have patience for first, to maximise the trait options from decrypting engrams. Stability is helpful with the bullet output, but a little extra Range or Handling is useful too.

// Pizzicato-22 PvE first-choice roll
// Extended Barrel, Ricochel Rounds, Perpetual Motion, Ensemble, Osmosis
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Good overall stats, but has 1 less point of Zoom than its competitors, so you might need to add a little extra range to make up for that with the barrel and mag choices - Extended Barrel does this and take the Recoil Direction to a maximum 100. Ricochet Rounds then pushes Range out by a total of about 1.25m, and smooths things with a dab of Stability too. Perpetual Motion anywhere or Ensemble in a fireteam both help with gunfeel stats and, if you haven't already got an Osmosis SMG you really only need one in your Vault, it'll give you another option for weapon energy type, which can be useful in solo endgame content.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content, particularly for Barrier Champions or solar burn activities. Shapeable. Good stats by comparison with other energy Precision frame ARs. Focus on Handling or Stability in the barrel, as with the Precision Frame you don't need to worry about Recoil Direction,  and Armor-Piercing Rounds adds 5% damage against shields. For end-game content, especially when the relevant anti-Barrier Champion mod's around or in solar burn activities, Adaptive Munitions will quickly take down barriers and shields, and Turnabout gives you an overshield.

// Ammit AR2 PvE first-choice roll
// Polygonal Rifling, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Armor-Piercing Rounds, High-Calibre Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Flared Magwell, Light Mag, Appended Mag, Ambitious Assassin, Triple Tap, Incandescent
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE backup roll for general content, particularly for solar subclasses. Shapeable. Good stats by comparison with other energy Precision frame ARs. Focus on Handling or Stability in the barrel, as with the Precision Frame you don't need to worry about Recoil Direction,  and virtually any other magazine except perhaps Alloy Mag or Extended Mag will work fine. For solar subclasses using Incandescent for scorch and ignite and Triple Tap or Ambitious Assassin will make the most of the magazine. Recommended MW: Handling, Stability or Reload Speed, with a damage-boosting Minor, Major or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, pve-champion, controller, mkb

// Taipan-4fr PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling, Enhanced Battery, Triple Tap, Firing Line
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for sustained damage against bosses in end-game content. Shapeable. An end-game LFR that you don't need to complete a Raid, Dungeon or Trials for, which works for both burst and sustained damage, especially with the Veist Stinger origin trait throwing in extra shots for free at random. A Handling barrel just makes using it snappier, and Enhanced Battery with Backup Mag gets you to the magic seven shots in your battery, to give the origin trait ten shots with Triple Tap to proc if you hit crits. For Raid bosses or static bosses, where you'll be in a fireteam as a group, Firing Line adds a solid 20% bonus damage. Recommended MW: Handling or Charge Time, with a Backup Mag mod. tags:pve, pve-boss, pve-endgame, pve-god, controller, mkb

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Shapeable. The Origin Perk is aimed at playing with a fireteam - the larger, the better your magazine size after reload will be.

Arrowhead Brake will straighten up the recoil direction, but to be honest you could go with boosts to stability or handling instead. Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell help with stability and reload speed.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Shapeable. The Origin Perk is aimed at playing with a fireteam - the larger, the better your magazine size after reload will be. Good in-slot stats and a great perk pool will give probably give you crafting headaches to shape and level all the rolls you might want! With a Precision Frame, you won't need to worry too much about recoil direction, and you already have tonnes of range, so focus on Stability and Handling, with Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell to help further with stability and reload speed. Although less useful with precision weapons although reloading in a fireteam with the origin perk should give you plenty of shots to use to proc, your SOFA Stats/ One For All roll is a good as ever for gunfeel stat and damage boosts.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content. Shapeable. The Origin Perk is aimed at playing with a fireteam - the larger, the better your magazine size after reload will be. Good in-slot stats, plus the lowest Zoom in class.

@description:Season 18 weapons with Right Hook origin trait

// Brigand's Law PvE first-choice roll
// Chambered Compensator, Arrowhead Brake, Extended Barrel, Appended Mag, Threat Detector, Perpetual Motion, Surrounded
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 31. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content assuming you're brave!. The Origin Perk works well in CQC, and in particular for melee-heavy playstyles. Any of the recoil direction barrels will get you to the maximum 100, and Appended Mag gets you to the maximum base size of 18, with no penalties. Threat Detector or Perpetual Motion both add to useful stats Threat Detector, in particular, works with the Origin Trait's CQC focus, and in the final trait column, Surrounded gives a huge passive boost to CQC damage.

// Sailspy Pitchglass PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Extended Battery, Clown Cartridge, Focused Fury
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 31. PvE first-choice roll for endgame content. The Origin Perk works well in CQC, so won't be much use for a LFR. Struggles in a field dominated by Stormchaser, but it is better than Tarantula, if you're looking to replace a roll. Arrowhead Brake should help with landing repeated crit shots, and Enhanced Battery is the only real choice in your second column. For Boss damage, Clown Cartridge and Focused Fury are you best sustained damage combination - get three crits, and then the rest of the magazine does 20% bonus damage.

Very stiff competition in-slot from Fatebringer, Eyasluna and DFA, but there are a few trait combinations that help claim a spot in your Vault. Look to boost Handling and Stability with sight and mag, to help gunfeel or maybe add a bullet or two. For end-game, particularly solo, content, it's difficult to top Demolitionist and Osmosis to give you an additional element to help break shields.

// No Hesitation First-choice PvE
// Hammer-Forged Rifling, Full Bore, Extended Barrel, Accurized Rounds, Physic, Circle of Life
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 106 from 18 June 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/0GYlriUxhFqNHGLqb84C1G?si=bb5a2c9b339d4c35 with @ImpetusAlways, @CourtProjects and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies and fireteam support in end-game content, particularly with solar/prismatic fragments that boost healing. Shapeable. A new Support frame auto-rifle subtype that builds healing charges on enemy hits there's a semi-circle below the reticule that fills up which you can then hip fire at allies to heal them. Hitting six hipfire shots on an ally heals 12 health per hit, and starts x1 Restoration for 4s after 6 rapid hits. This also grants both Guardians a +10% "Support Frame boost" to damage for 5s, which stacks with every other damage buff source. No Hesitation is probably the strongest solar primary currently in the game, if you're in a fireteam. It's a bit weird to fire as it's not hitscan - but if you can get used to Osteo Striga's tracking shots, you'll do fine. First off M+KB players might benefit from a bit of extra range from the barrel and mag perks. The first and second trait column perks can double down on the frame intrinsic perks through Physic which grants x1 Restoration x2 when enhanced for 5s to both you and allies when procced, and Circle of Life which boosts damage on healing by an additional +25% for 10s +37.5% total for the first 5s with the Support Frame Boost for both you and the healed Guardian. The Dealer's Choice origin trait is nice to have who doesn't love more super energy? - with two or three Pale Heart weapons, you'll notice the difference!

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies and fireteam support in end-game content, particularly with solar/prismatic fragments that boost healing. Shapeable. A new Support frame auto-rifle subtype that builds healing charges on enemy hits there's a semi-circle below the reticule that fills up which you can then hip fire at allies to heal them. Hitting six hipfire shots on an ally heals 12 health per hit, and starts x1 Restoration for 4s after 6 rapid hits. This also grants both Guardians a +10% "Support Frame boost" to damage for 5s, which stacks with every other damage buff source.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Midnight Coup's stats are a bit of a mixed bag in what's a very competitive subfamily. The recoil pulls a little to the right so you can sort that with Arrowhead Brake, or boost the stability with the barrel perk. For general content, you can get access to two damage traits - Firefly in the first column for the AoE crit kill explosion and a reload speed boost. The AoE damage against nearby adds will help proc One for All in the second column to help tear through adds. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade or melee energy according to your subclass type.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Blast Furnace reappears with great stats as a well-rounded example of what is a pretty rare subfamily of Aggressive Burst frame pulse rifles, with a choice of barrels rather than the original's sights. The Rasmussen sight is decent although you don't get any of the stat bonuses. The recoil is 65 at base, so vertical if a bit ragged - Handling is probably where to invest barrel park stats through Fluted Barrel or Arrowhead Brake. In the mag perk slot, Flared Magwell and Tactical Mag are both solid. It's not often you get the option of two AoE damage traits - Kinetic Tremors takes 11 hits to proc - one less when enhanced - and Dragonfly adds to the fun with a solar explosion and a reload boost on a crit kill. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade or melee energy according to your subclass type.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. This is the fourth iteration of Hung Jury SR4 Shiny, and it's as much of a stat monster as ever. Being a precision frame, you don't really need to worry about recoil direction, and as a scout rifle you don't need to think about range either - use the barrel and mag perks to boost handling or stability, and maybe a little reload speed instead. The BRAVE Hung Jury offers Kinetic Tremors in the first trait perk column, which you can pair with another damage perk in the second - Desperate Measures escalates to 30% damage after a kill, Firefly provides AoE and reload speed on a crit kill. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade of melle energy according to your subclass type.

// Hung Jury SR4 PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Corkscrew Rifling, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Appended Mag, Kinetic Tremors, Desperate Measures, Firefly
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 102 from 23 April 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/5kuhrmYKBDwvLtzZJQmxiK?si=7f73118bec6743ac with @Saint_Kabr, @ImpetusAlways and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. This is the fourth iteration of Hung Jury SR4, and it's as much of a stat monster as ever. Being a precision frame, you don't really need to worry about recoil direction, and as a scout rifle you don't need to think about range either - use the barrel and mag perks to boost handling or stability, and maybe a little reload speed instead. The BRAVE Hung Jury offers Kinetic Tremors in the first trait perk column, which you can pair with another damage perk in the second - Desperate Measures escalates to 30% damage after a kill, Firefly provides AoE and reload speed on a crit kill. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade of melle energy according to your subclass type. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, mkb, controller

@title:Reprised Prophecy and Trials of the Nine weapons
@description:Refreshed Prophecy dungeon and Trials of the Nine weapons with Crossing Over origin trait

// Adjudicator PvE first-choice roll
// Chambered Compensator, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Alloy Mag, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Feeding Frenzy, Threat Detector, Perpetual Motion, Subsistence, Onslaught
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 97 from 13 March 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4Uy7pfo5Thjtt2MF4vZitv?si=8e3adcb68d234006 with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content. Adjudicator has decent stats and, with a precision frame, you don't need to worry too much about the published Recoil Direction. A little extra stability helps keep bullets on target, and a little extra range is nice, so Smallbore or Corkscrew Rifling can help out, or Chambered Compensator can take Recoil Direction to 100 as well as adding stability, You'll be emptying the mag a lot, so reload speed is the magazine perk choice - Alloy Mag, Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell all help. In the first trait column as the support park, Feeding Frenzy, Threat Detector, Perpetual Motion and Subsistence all speed up reload as well as bumping up other useful stats, or delay the need to reload, for you to keep uptime for Onslaught, in the second trait column, to boost RPM for additional damage to mow down adds. The Crossing Over origin trait is useful all around for PvE, with bumps to range and handling in the top half of a magazine, and a small 3% damage boost at the bottom - Subsistence kills keeps feeding ammo into the bottom half of the mag to extend the time the extra damage is procced. Recommended MW: Stability or Reload Speed, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, mkb, controller

// Prosecutor PvE first-choice roll
// Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, High Caliber Rounds, Armor Piercing Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Flared Magwell, Keep Away, Voltshot
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 97 from 13 March 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4Uy7pfo5Thjtt2MF4vZitv?si=8e3adcb68d234006 with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content. Prosecutor has decent stats by comparison to its peers and as it's a precision frame, you should find it fairly easy to control despite the 69 recoil direction. With that being the case, you can push out the range with the barrel perk, and any of the combat effect rounds as a mag perk will add a little more - High-Cal rounds in particular will help stun your minor adds. If you're looking at Voltshot in the second trait column. you're going to need s snappy reload, so Flared Magwell can work well too. Keep Away is the only perk in the first trait column to add to reload, although to benefit, you'll need to keep your engagement solidly in the mid-range. Voltshot is fun, but remember that the perk inherits the weapon's combatant damage scaling, so it won't be as effective at clearing add crowds as a Voltshot hand cannon. The Crossing Over origin trait is useful all around for PvE, with bumps to range and handling in the top half of a magazine, and a small 3% damage boost at the bottom.

// Relentless PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Armor Piercing Rounds, High Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Light Mag, Flared Magwell, Slice, Hatchling
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 97 from 13 March 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4Uy7pfo5Thjtt2MF4vZitv?si=8e3adcb68d234006 with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content, particularly with a Strand subclass. Relentless returns as a Strand pulse rifle with below average stats that reveal its Season 1 origin. The recoil direction of 65 is vertical, if a little loose, so you either look to improve it further or, if you can handle the recoil, push out the range with your barrel perk. Any of the combat effect mag perks add further range in addition to the bullet behaviour, or Light Mag and Flared Magwell improve reload speed. You don't need to run a strand subclass but if you do then Slice and Hatchling can sever enemies to reduce their damage output very useful in a boss fight to help your fireteam, and generate Threadlings for additional damage to synergise with your fragments. The Crossing Over origin trait is useful all around for PvE, with bumps to range and handling in the top half of a magazine, and a small 3% damage boost at the bottom.

// Darkest Before PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Armor Piercing Rounds, High Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Flared Magwell, Light Mag, Heal Clip Incandescent
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 97 from 13 March 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4Uy7pfo5Thjtt2MF4vZitv?si=8e3adcb68d234006 with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content, particularly with a Solar subclass. Darkest Before is back in a solar, rather than arc configuration, with the same strong stat package as before. The recoil direction of 64 is pretty controllable, but if you want to make it even more reliable, Arrowhead Brake will take it to 94. If you're happy with the recoil, there's no harm in pushing out the range with your barrel perk instead. Any of the combat effect mag perks add further range in addition to the bullet behaviour, or Light Mag and Flared Magwell improve reload speed. You can find the Heal Clip/ Incandescent trait perk combination on other pulse rifles but it is very nice to help keep your fireteam's health topped up, while you're incinerating crowds of minor spec adds while synergising with your solar subcalss fragments. The Crossing Over origin trait is useful all around for PvE, with bumps to range and handling in the top half of a magazine, and a small 3% damage boost at the bottom. Recommended MW: Range or Handling, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, mkb, controller

// The Title PvE first-choice roll
// Corkscrew Rifling, Smallbore, Fluid Barrel Polygonal Rifling, High-Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Alloy Mag, Flared Magwell, Repulsor Brace, Destabilizing Rounds
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 98 from 19 March 2024 https://open.spotify.com/episode/0cxvW6vTZVWtwmXkqr7g1f?si=66932432408046d2 with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content, particularly for void subclasses. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. The Title has decent stats in a crowded and competitive subfamily, including vertical recoil of 85 and 15 zoom, where 14 is the norm. Use the barrel perk to boost handling and/or stability, and the the combat effect magazine perks all have a place, or just look to boost reload speed with Alloy Mag or Flared Magwell. You can find the combination of Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds on a few different weapons - you could argue that it's better on auto-rifles like Ros Arago or Age-Old Bond - but the combination of an overshield and volatile enemies in CQC is definitely a fun one, especially when paired with void fragments like Echo of Persistence. The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful - who would say no to extra class ability energy? Hakke Breach Armaments adds damage to vehicles and constructs, but that's probably not as useful here. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, mkb, controller

// Ros Arago IV PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Smallbore, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Rewind Rounds, Subsistence, Onslaught
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 934 https://open.spotify.com/episode/0M24D3moUjRCXj0AtIsCCx?si=208c6d31bdb7453e with @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor spec enemies in general content. There aren't that many void auto-rifles obtainable in S23 and, while Ros Arago IV stats aren't great, there are still a couple of fun rolls worth looking out for. The Recoil Direction could probably do with some taming - Arrowhead Brake takes it to a much better looking 77. Otherwise, if you can control the shots, Smallbore adds a decent bump to range and stability as the barrel perk. In the magazine per slot, you could make an argument for Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell or Accurized Rounds to round out the stats a little further. Looking at Onslaught in the second trait column, the obvious pairings to keep the magazine topped off in the first column are Rewind Rounds or Subsistence. Finally, the submunitions generated by the Wild Card origin trait are great for helping soften up crowds.

// Belisarius-D PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Flared Magwell, Light Mag, Alloy Mag, Slice, Rapid Hit, Keep Away, Hatchling
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 93 https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uYGSQqlyX1faCyATCDuno?si=IMSCRgTRQr-_THJdjxFMIQ with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor spec enemies in end-game content, particularly for Strand subclasses. Belisarius-D Belisarius isn't a dinosaur, but rather a 5th Century Byzantine general has strong stats but, like all Aggressive Burst pulse rifles, suffers poor handling and reload speed. Arrowhead Brake adds handling and corrects the recoil direction to 100 or Fluted Barrel gives the highest handling bump as the barrel perk. Flared Magwell, or as an alternative, Light Mag or Alloy Mag help out with reload in the magazine slot. The traits are mostly PvP flavoured but Slice and Hatchling in the first and second trait columns work together as a weapon to synergise with Strand subclass fragments - this could make it a good option as part of a Bait and Switch rotation with Slice reducing outgong damage from a major boss by 40% when procced - or alternatively, Rapid Hit and Keep Away, again in the first column bump up gunfeel stats. Short Action Stock is the stock of choice, for another +15 to handling. Recommended MW: Handling, with a damage boosting Boss Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

// Breakneck PvE first-choice roll
// Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Polygonal Rifling, Extended Mag, Appended Mag, Subsistence, Onslaught
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 93 https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uYGSQqlyX1faCyATCDuno?si=IMSCRgTRQr-_THJdjxFMIQ with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor spec enemies in general content. Breakneck is back, and has very solid stats, although it looks like we're never going to see the OG and OP Rampage/ Onslaught version again. As a precision frame AR, you don't need to worry about recoil direction, so if you want a variation on the curated version, you might prefer Smallbore or Corkscrew Rifling as your barrel park, but Extended Magazine or Appended Magazine are definitely the top two options for the magazine. For your general content add-clearing, the combination of Subsistence and Onslaught in the first and second trait columns should minimise your need to reloads while you're working your way through crowds of adds. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, mkb, controller

// Appetence PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Chambered Compensator, Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling, Ionized Battery, Overflow, Headstone
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 92 https://open.spotify.com/episode/2qpoxXfXzBXohHBrdQnHbd?si=aH9jqq3kRwOtwQoh2YhHDA with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing Minor spec enemies in general content, particularly with a Stasis subclass. Shapeable. Appetence which means "a natural craving, desire or affinity", seeing as you're asking is the first legendary Stasis trace rifle. It has decent stats, and some interesting trait combinations. Take your pick of handling and/or stability and maybe a touch of recoil direction, if you need it to be a perfect 100, for the barrel perk. With an eye on Overflow as the support perk in the first trait column, Ionized Battery maximises the battery size. Enhanced Overflow gives you 229 in the battery, and 476 total ammo so 247 in reserve with no Reserve mods, up to 606 with three, and with it topping up the battery, for just picking up an ammo brick, you might never need to reload. Headstone generates Stasis crystals on crit kills, so lets you build into Stasis verbs and fragments. The Dragon's Vengeance origin trait can be useful, although it only procs once your health bar turns red or an ally dies. You'll get a reload and 11s of a boost to range and either charge rate or handling.

// Waking Vigil PvE first-choice roll
// Smallbore, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Extended Barrel, Full Bore, Armor-Piercing Rounds, High-Calibre Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Subsistence, Kinetic Tremors, Attrition Orbs, Rapid Hit, Perpetual Motion, Voltshot
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 91 https://open.spotify.com/episode/50NPk7xF3Tt6X3DVucE9jU?si=44d2b7d44a5a4aec with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in general content, particularly with an arc subclass. As a former Lightweight HC that's been crowbarred into the Adaptive subfamily, the stats look very weird, with low range and stability but high handling and reload speed. If you haven't already got a decent arc hand cannon, then you could push out the range a bit, even at the cost of a little Handling, and add a little Stability. Any of the combat effect rounds in the mag perk slot Armor-Piercing, High-Caliber or Ricochet Rounds will add a tiny bit more range and utility in a firefight. Rapid Hit is the best support perk choice in the first column traits, although Perpetual Motion isn't bad either. If you don't already have a Voltshot hand cannon, this gives you access to one - jolting enemies lets you play into arc subclass verbs, and is great for crowd control and chunking down bulkier adds and the occasional major. The Advanced Reflexes origin trait is quite useful in PvE - when activated by an enemy hit, it adds +30 Handling for additional ready and ADS speed, together with a handy +20 Mobility, for 7.5s.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in general content, particularly with a void subclass. The reprised Vouchsafe has returned with a plethora of PvE possibilities. You get the +20 Mobility from the Lightweight Frame, which is always great but on the downside you also have low Stability and Handling not such a problem with the origin trait and abysmal Recoil Direction. You can handle the wonky recoil with a combination of recoil and/or stability perks in the barrel and mag slots. You don't need a void subclass to make use of the trait combination of Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds - they'll work perfectly well without - but you can improve the effect with void fragments. The Advanced Reflexes origin trait is quite useful in PvE - when activated by an enemy hit, it adds +30 Handling for additional ready and ADS speed, together with a handy +20 Mobility, for 7.5s.

// Stay Frosty PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds, Appended Mag, Enlightened Action, Collective Action
//notes: Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 91 https://open.spotify.com/episode/50NPk7xF3Tt6X3DVucE9jU?si=44d2b7d44a5a4aec with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in general content, particularly with a Stasis subclass. Like most world-drop weapons, Stay Frosty has pretty low stats by comparison to its subtype peers, so only keep a roll if it fills a gap in your vault. The recoil direction is directly up, but could do with tightening - Arrowhead Brake takes it to a controllable 85. For the mag perk, choose between Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds and Appended Mag for additional stat boosts. There's not much for PvE in the first trait column - Enlightened Action provides some nice reload speed and handling boosts is the best support perk available. If you're running a Stasis subclass, Stasis shards should be pretty easy to generate for Collective Action to use for a 20% damage boost for 7s although you can interact with any elemental drop. The Dawning Surprise origin trait is very useful in PvE - when the behind the scenes counter hits 100, the surprise is spawned on the ground for 10s and grants 10% energy to all abilities, grants 20HP and starts shield/health regeneration.

First-choice PvE pick for Strand synergy Minor Spec add-clearing in general content. Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Vengeful Whisper is no exception - even going as far as an extra point of zoom over other precision bows. This also has traits appearing in non-standard columns to make for some unique rolls. As with every bow, the aim is to reduce draw time first, and improve accuracy second - Elastic String does the first job and Fiberglass Arrow Shaft or Straight Fletching does the second. With Explosive Head appearing in the first trait column as the support perk for a change, you have the option to go double-damage with Hatchling unfortunately Precision Instrument only boosts precision damage so is a bit of a trap perk with Explosive Head, particularly when paired with Thread of Evolution. The origin trait is situationally useful if you're in a construct-heavy environment, like the Warlord's Ruin dungeon itself.

// Dragoncult Sickle PvE first-choice roll
// Enduring Blade, Hungry Edge, Tempered Edge, Swordmaster's Guard, Unrelenting, Tireless Blade, Chain Reaction, Hatchling
//notes: Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 90 https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C3Wx7xXVw10WshiLn5sT8?si=ZNEiHi_ZRfW5z3BbkOMrVQ with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways, and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. This is the first new Caster-Frame sword we've seen in some time, and the first Strand one. Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Dragoncult Sickle is no exception, having pretty good overall stats - both Impact and Ammo Capacity are higher than its peers. The advantage you have with caster frames is that you can hit from range with the heavy attack, but the ammo cost as at v7.3.0.3 is still a little high. If you're using this for add-clearing, one hit will equal one kill consistently so you might as well go for increased ammo with the blade perk. Swordmaster's Guard as the Guard perk improves regeneration of the heavy attack and then either Unrelenting or Tireless Blade provides health regeneration or ammo from thin air in the first trait column, and Chain Reaction or Hatchling particularly with Thread of Evolution help with add clearing in the second. The origin trait is situationally useful if you're in a construct-heavy environment, like the Warlord's Ruin dungeon itself. Recommended MW: Impact, with a damage boosting Major, Boss or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-endgame, pve-god, mkb, controller

@title:Season 22 Festival of the Lost weapons
@description:New and reprised weapons from Festival of the Lost, with the Search Party origin trait

// Horror Story PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Smallbore, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Accurized Rounds, Demolitionist, Enlightened Action, Headstone
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 83 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ISDC0TSrLmfEyPuI9oU2m?si=9fbd5a7cf0bc4f07 with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for Stasis synergy and add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content. Horror Story has returned and become a stasis precision auto-rifle - the first of its subtype. The stats are unexceptional, as you might expect from an event weapon but there are some trait combinations to save it. Recoil direction doesn't really matter on a precision-frame weapon, and stability is less important with a more reliable recoil direction, so you can choose your pick of Handling, Range and Reload Speed from your barrel and mag perks. Enlightened Action will get you pretty close to maxed out Handling and Reload at 5 stacks, or Demolitionist is difficult to turn down when it shows up in the first trait column as the support perk. In the second as the signature perk, Headstone is the main Stasis synergy trait, giving you crystals to work with your fragment, or burst and get even more grenade energy back with Demolitionist. Both origin traits are more PvP-orientated, but Nadir Focus's extra range and accuracy for free is a nice little bonus. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, mkb, controller

// Jurassic Green PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag, Heal Clip, Incandescent
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 83 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ISDC0TSrLmfEyPuI9oU2m?si=9fbd5a7cf0bc4f07 with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for solar synergy and Minor Spec add-clearing in general content. Jurassic Green is a solar rapid-fire pulse, with the intrinsic 20% faster reload when its magazine is empty. It's got a similar stat range to its other world-drop peers, but comes a poor second to end-game drops in the energy slot. The recoil direction is a frankly awful 50 at base. The best even Arrowhead Brake can do is bring it up to a not entirely awful 80. Looking at the traits, you'll need to prioritise reload speed with the mag perk - Flared Magwell or Tactical Mag, together with the Masterwork. The new to season 22 Heal Clip in the first trait column as the support perk will apply one stack of Cure to you and anyone else near on reloading after a kill, while Incandescent spreads scorch and ignite to help clear adds - two solar verbs in a single package to enhance with your fragments. The Field Tested origin trait will just work steadily in the background to gradually improve your gunfeel, as long as you don't die!

Backup PvE pick for solar synergy and Minor Spec add-clearing in general content, if you don't already have a decent Incandescent pulse rifle, and haven't got around to shaping a BXR-55 Battler yet. Jurassic Green is a solar rapid-fire pulse, with the intrinsic 20% faster reload when its magazine is empty. It's got a similar stat range to its other world-drop peers, but comes a poor second to end-game drops in the energy slot. The recoil direction is a frankly awful 50 at base. The best even Arrowhead Brake can do is bring it up to a not entirely awful 80, and you can choose a little extra range, stability or reload speed with your mag slot perk. Then, in the first trait column as the support perk there are a few decent options to help with reload and gunfeel - Keep Away, Loose Change, Perpetual Motion and Subsistence. Incandescent in the second column as the signature perk is great for add clear, as you spread solar scorch and ignite around. The Field Tested origin trait is probably the better PvE trait of the two - it'll just work steadily in the background to gradually improve your gunfeel, as long as you don't die!

First-choice PvE pick for Strand synergy and add clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content. Barrel and Mag re-shapeable. This is the first rapid-fire Strand scout rifle so you get an Alloy Mag-like 20% quicker reload animation when the magazine is empty, with best-in-class stats compared to other RFs in the kinetic slot. The recoil direction is a bit shonky, so Arrowhead Brake cleans that up a bit, but if you feel able to control it, Fluted Barrel adds to handling for general snappiness. You can choose from any of the combat effect rounds as the mag perk, depending on your preference. For your Strand Synergy, Rapid Hit helps with reload speed and stability, or Rewind Rounds extends your magazine in the first trait column as the support park, while Hatchling is the Strand option-de-jour in the second column as the signature perk. The Cursed Thrall origin perk synergises well with melee builds and is a lot of fun for helping soften up groups of enemies when active.

First-choice PvE pick for Solar synergy add-clear against Minor Spec enemies in general content. Shapeable. High Impact Auto-Rifles aren't really first choice for PvE - they do have good range, and the frame intrinsic provides more accuracy when stationary or slow-moving, but Abyss Defiant has great stats and trait combinations, so may be worth a try. Handling is always low on HIs, so Fluted Barrel is your top barrel perk choice, although Arrowhead Brake does take recoil direction to 100, so is a decent option as well. In the mag perk slot, Flared Magwell offers the biggest boost to reload speed. The fun solar combination when you're not too underlevelled is the new-to-season-22 Heal Clip in the first trait column as the support perk, for a burst of Cure for you and anyone nearby when reloading after a kill, and Incandescent in the second column as the signature perk for add control and working with the scorth and ignite verbs.

The fun solar combination when you're not too underlevelled is the new-to-season-22 Heal Clip in the first trait column as the support perk, for a burst of Cure for you and anyone nearby when reloading after a kill, and Incandescent in the second column as the signature perk for add control and working with the scorth and ignite verbs. The Cursed Thrall origin perk synergises well with melee builds and is a lot of fun for helping soften up groups of enemies when active. Recommended MW: Reload Speed, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, mkb, controller

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content. First-choice PvE pick for void synergy and add-clear against Minor Spec enemies in general content. Shapeable. Word of Crota drops with perfect recoil direction made even more perfect, if that's possible, by the intrinsic frame trait and best-in-slot stats so is definitely worth a look. You can use the barrel and mag perks to fill out gunfeel stats to your liking. For void synergy, you can use both current void traits - Repulsor Brace in the first column as the support perk, and Destabilizing Rounds in the second as the signature perk. Get your first kill, to spread volatility in groups of adds, and kill one to get a void overshield, and sync with void subclass verbs.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. The only other current lightweight SMG is Submission which is a stat monster, so Showrunner's stats look a bit poor by comparison, but there are still some interesting PvE rolls worth considering. Lightweights give you +20 Mobility and +6.25% to movement speed as the frame bonus to start. You can push out the range with the barrel perk - on M&KB, Full Bore provides an extra 1.36m of ADS range, and any of the combat effect rounds pushes that out an additional 0.45m. There are plenty of ways to proc the gunfeel boosts you get from Well Rounded and, once you've done that you can collect any generated elemental pickups to proc Collective Action which is unusual to see on a Kinetic weapon for a 20% damage boost. The Nadir Focus Origin Trait adding range and accuracy on repeated hits isn't game-changing, but it is nice to have.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content. Nightshade is back - the same lightweight frame as in vanilla D2, which now gives you +20 Mobility and +6.25% to movement speed, but this time as a Strand weapon. The stats are solid by comparison with other kinetic options. Start by straightening up the recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake, and then add one of the combat effect rounds - Ricochet also adds stability, but they are all useful. In the first trait column as the support park, either Enlightened Action boosts reload speed and handling to maximum in two 3-round bursts, or Outlaw maximises reload and applies a scalar. To pair with this in the second column signature slot, Collective Action boosts damage by 20% for 7s on an Elemental Pickup, or Kill Clip adds 25% damage for 5s after a precision kill.

The new to S22 Heal Clip as the first column support perk provides you and any one nearby with a burst of Cure when you reload after a kill, or Demolitionist refunds grenade energy - pair either with Incandescent in the second column as the signature perk, for Solar synergy, with scorch and ignite kills adding to the grenade energy tally too. The Nadir Focus Origin Trait adding range and accuracy on repeated hits isn't game-changing, but it is nice to have. Recommended MW: Reload Speed or Handling, with a damage-boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, mkb, controller

First-choice PvE pick for Minor Spec add clear enemies in end-game content. Unending Tempest is probably the best kinetic slot precision SMG, with great stats in comparison to its peers, and with being able to forget about the recoil direction with the frame bonus. But, as it's a Crucible weapon, there is a huge trait pool, so if you do want the best chance of a usable drop, reset your ranks a few times first, before you focus your engrams. For M+KB, focus on range with your barrel and mag perks - stability is less useful and you can use trait perks to help boost handling and reload speed. Working backwards, Frenzy as the signature perk maxes out handling and reload speed, as well as adding 15% to damage. It's always great to see Demolitionist in the first trait column as your support perk for more grenades, and who doesn't love that, and the occasional instant refill when you throw one. The Nadir Focus origin trait in may be more PvP orientated, but free extra range and accuracy is a nice bonus.

// The Guiding Sight PvE first-choice roll
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 77 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RxkTOwLINWvKzUitNoAFy?si=1426d1f760c544b5 with @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr while @CourtProjects is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for Strand synergy and Minor Spec enemies in general content. The good news is that reprised Guiding Sight is now a Strand Scout Rifle. the bad news is that it's still a high-Impact frame, so it's the least competitive subtype. The stats are decent, so this might be an easier to obtain option, if you've not got a Strand scout already. With the barrel, you can buff some of the low stats - Handling and Stability, and then the mag can help with the reload speed, or just choose from one of the combat effect mags. For Strand synergy, Hatchling as the second trait column signature perk generates Threadlings on a crit kill - make sure you have the Thread of Generation fragment to make the most of them. As the first column support column perk to work with Hatchling, you could choose from Demolitionist and even more Threadlings for Warlocks, or Enlightened Action or Perpetual Motion add nice bumps to gunfeel stats. Recommended MW: Handling or Stability, with a damage-boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, mkb, controller

// Greasy Luck PvE first-choice roll
// Supercooled Accelerator, Auxiliary Reserves, Light Mag, Appended Mag, Drop Mag, Accurized Rounds, Swap Mag, Disruption Break, Close to Melee
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 67 https://open.spotify.com/episode/3wGaXiUGMNodLkPkGFdBd3?si=42e0db2e63a443b7 with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in general activities. The first rapid-fire legendary glaive, which looks like it offers high rate-of-fire, handling and reload speed, but lower range, impact and shield duration. Supercooled Accelerator seems like the best of the haft perks to boost the range, or Auxiliary Reserves helps shore up the Shield Duration, both at the cost of one or both of handling and reload. There's not really a top pick for your mag, except to avoid Extended Mag. For glaive melee fans, the combination of Disruption Break in the first trait slot as the support perk weakens targets by 50% to kinetic damage for 5.5s once you've broken their shield with a glaive bolt and guess what? Glaive melees are kinetic, so you can slash away to your heart's content. If enemies don't have a shield, Close to Melee in the second column as the signature perk boosts your glaive melee damage by 30% for 10s for getting a projectile kill, with the timer being refreshed by 5s after another melee kill. The Restoration Ritual origin trait is also occasionally useful for an instant reload after proccing. Recommended MW: Stability, with a damage-boosting Minor or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, controller, mkb

// Rapacious Appetite PvE first-choice roll
// Full Bore, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Extended Barrel, Ricochet Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, High-Caliber Rounds, Light Mag, Flared Magwell, Perpetual Motion, Headstone
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 61 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XT0gPkoVSh3cM6gMtSupq?si=18db495353ca49ad with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities. Shapeable. Rapacious Appetite is one of only two Stasis aggressive SMGs as at S21, so there's not much to compare the stats against. But even so, the stability of 6 might make you pause. On the plus side, the range is the highest in the subfamily. Fortunately, for mouse and keyboard, you can ignore the stability and just go for range with the barrel choice and masterwork. In the mag, the Combat Effect perks all provide utility, you can boost Reload Speed through Light Mag or Flared Magwell. The easiest way to add the gunfeel stats you need in an end-game roll is through Perpetual Motion in the first trait column as your support perk or, alternatively you can extend the useful magazine through Fourth Time's The Charm. Then, to synergise with Stasis subclasses, Headstone in the second column as the signature perk, of you don't already have a Headstone Blood Feud SMG, provides a Stasis crystal on crit kills to use with Aspects and Fragments. Recommended MW: Range, with a damage-boosting Minor or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, pve-endgame, mkb

In general, non-endgame content Outlaw and Subsistence are both great for weapon uptime in the first trait column as your signature perk while, in the second column as the signature perk, the first stack of Golden Tricorn is easy to proc for 15% bonus damage, even if the second stack is more difficult to proc with a Strand subclass.

First-choice PvE pick for add clear in general content. Shapeable. Different Times is the first Strand pulse rifle but has poor base stats when compared with other kinetic slot options. While the Recoil Direction is terrible, we'll control that with one of the traits. Fluted Barrel or Smallbore help fill in a combination of handling, stability or range. Flared Magwell further fills in some gunfeel stats, or the Combat Effect magazine perks are all viable. To help control the recoil, Heating Up adds both stability and recoil direction after a kill to make this very easy to use, and, as this is the first primary weapon able to roll Collective Action, in the second column as the signature perk, that's probably the roll to go for, proccing 20% bonus damage for any elemental pickup.

// Spare Rations PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Smallbore, Flared Magwell, Appended Mag, Subsistence, Kinetic Tremors
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 61 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XT0gPkoVSh3cM6gMtSupq?si=18db495353ca49ad with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for Minor add-clearing in general content. Spare Rations is in a difficult place stats-wise still having the lower stats of the old 150 Lightweight subfamily even though it's been rolled into the Adaptives. However, it's the first hand cannon that can drop with Kinetic Tremors, so it might be worth keeping around in case a rework makes it a bit easier to proc. Fill in some of the stats with the barrel - Fluted Barrel or Smallbore bump your preference between range, stability and handling. In the mag, Flared Magwell bumps stats up a bit more, or Appended Mag gets you to the maximum of 14 shots. For general add clearing Subsistence in the first trait column as the support park keeps your magazine topped up as you get kills. In the second column as the signature perk, Kinetic Tremors does currently v7.1.0.2, S21 take six hits to proc, but if that's ever given a buff, this could be great for AoE damege for a group of adds while collecting ammo and orbs remotely.

First-choice PvE pick for Solar synergy and Minor add-clearing in general content. If you haven't got an Incandescent Calus Mini-Tool, the Bug-Out Bag could be a very acceptable alternative. Decent stats, but Fluted Barrel or Smallbore layer on useful gunfeel stat bumps. Flared Magwell adds further stability and reload speed bumps, or any of the Combat Effect magazine perks adds utility, and a little range on top. In the first trait column as the support perk, Subsistence keeps your magazine topped up after a kill, and Incandescent as the second column signature perk is great for add clearing and builds into your scorch and ignite Solar verbs.

@title:Season 21 Last Wish weapons
@description:The Giggity episode, presenting reprised Last Wish raid weapons with the Explosive Pact origin trait

// Chattering Bone PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag, Kill Clip, Rampage
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 69 https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZIEMYfNzOu5TyLlLhU7hH?si=90ffff909a2e40f2 with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects - @ImpetusAlways is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for add-clear use in general activities. Shapeable. Not a huge selection of Lightweight Pulse Rifles to compare with, but Chattering Bone is still best-in-class stats across the board, and provides a +20 mobility bonus and 6.25% faster movement speed. Even if it's best in class, the recoil direction still needs attention - Arrowhead Break takes it to a controllable 87, and adds a bump to handling. Either Flared Magwell or Tactical Mag will speed up the reload with ideally a reload speed masterwork fast reloads keep the two damage perks uptime maximised, as well as adding in some stability and, in the latter's case, an extra burst. The old spicy Kill Clip/Rampage roll is still available, and is unique on a pulse rifle to this weapon as at S21. Proccing both gives a whopping 66.2% damage bump to go on a roll with. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear use in end-game activities. Shapeable. Not a huge selection of Lightweight Pulse Rifles to compare with, but Chattering Bone is still best-in-class stats across the board, and provides a +20 mobility bonus and 6.25% faster movement speed. Even if it's best in class, the recoil direction still needs attention - Arrowhead Break takes it to a controllable 87, and adds a bump to handling. If you're on M+KB, stability will be less of a concern, so you can afford to push out range, so Accurized Rounds is your best choice, and then on top of that, Keep Away in the first trait column as the support perk will add additional range and accuracy bonuses to make crits easier, even if it's normally thought of as a PvP perk. Finally, as the second column signature perk, Kinetic Tremors only needs four bursts to land to proc. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

// Transfiguration PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Rampage, Kill Clip
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 69 https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZIEMYfNzOu5TyLlLhU7hH?si=90ffff909a2e40f2 with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects - @ImpetusAlways is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for add-clear use in general activities. Shapeable. Transfiguration is the only obtainable high-impact scout rifle available as at S21, plus it has a solid set of stats, although reload is a bit slow. The range is pretty good - Fluted Barrel, Smallbore or Corkscrew Rifling all add useful bumps to stats, or if you want to push the range out by a few metres more, Hammer-Forged Rifling can also work in the barrel. Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell are the pick of the magazine perks, adding useful reload speed, a bit of stability and an extra shot for Tac Mag. This is the only scout rifle you can roll with Rampage and Kill Clip together which, when procced together, add 66.4% damage - possibly one that's more for memes, but it could still be fun.

// Transfiguration PvE first-choice roll
// Full Bore, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Rewind Rounds, Rampage, Explosive Payload
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 69 https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ZIEMYfNzOu5TyLlLhU7hH?si=90ffff909a2e40f2 with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects - @ImpetusAlways is on holiday. First-choice PvE pick for add-clear use in end-game activities. Shapeable. Transfiguration is the only obtainable high-impact scout rifle available as at S21, plus it has a solid set of stats, although reload is a bit slow. With less need to worry about stability on M+KB, you can go all into range with Full Bore and get an extra 2.5m from base. Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell are the pick of the magazine perks, adding useful reload speed, a bit of stability and an extra shot for Tac Mag. Explosive Payload in the second trait column as the signature perk is a straight boost to damage, with added flinch, and is great against champions. Working back, you could pair it with either Rewind Rounds, to extend the magazine - particularly useful with champions, or look to increasing your damage output with Rampage - Three stacks equates to an impressive extra 44.5% crit damage. If you're a grenade-heavy player, the Explosive Pact origin trait adds in some nice gunfeel boosts too.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear use in general activities. The reprised Messenger has a few new tricks for Season 21, which make it worth a look. Good stats across the board, except for recoil direction, which we can help out with Arrowhead Brake in the barrel slot, which takes it to a controllable 90. For the magazine perk, any of the "Rounds" mags or Flared Magwell work well. For your first trait column support perk, Rapid Hit and Perpetual Motion can both layer on addition gunfeel boosts on top. If you're running solo content, don't forget the Alacrity origin trait to pretty much max out every stat on the board, and add 10 Aim Assist too. Finally, in the second slot, for non-endgame content, Desperado can be fun, increasing your DPS output by 30% for 6s by reloading after a crit kill.

The Suros weapon for season 20 is the Coronach named after a funeral dirge sung, or played on the bagpipes, in Scotland and Ireland, a solar Adaptive auto rifle with the lowish stats you'd expect from a World drop. The Suros origin trait can help fill in a little Handling and flinch resistance after a reload although it's more commonly thought of as being more PvP-focussed.

The Suros weapon for season 20 is the Coronach named after a funeral dirge sung, or played on the bagpipes, in Scotland and Ireland, a solar Adaptive auto rifle with the lowish stats you'd expect from a World drop. The Suros origin trait can help fill in a little Handling and flinch resistance after a reload although it's more commonly thought of as being more PvP-focussed. Arrowhead Brake as your barrel perk takes Recoil Direction to 100 and adds Handling for snappiness. This is one of the first ARs with Target Lock, so if you choose that as your second trait column signature perk to build towards, Alloy Mag makes a lot of sense as the magazine perk - you need to be firing continuously until the mag is empty to build damage stacks. Although generally more of a PvP perk, Zen Moment as the support perk helps with the lowish stability to keep shots on target for Target Lock's stacking damage boost.

First-choice PvE roll for Strand synergy in general activities. Shapeable. This is the easier to get Strand adaptive auto-rifle for Season of Defiance, if you're unable to get into the Root of Nightmares Raid. The stats are decent, although both stability and handling are a little below par, and the recoil direction could maybe do with a little help, although the Noble Deeds origin perk can help out with the handling and reload speed too. Extended Barrel or Smallbore are your best barrel choices, and Tactical Mag is the best of the mag perks. In the first trait column, there aren't many support perks that help in PvE - Keep Away is the pick of a limited budget, or possibly the reworked Zen Moment. For your second trait column signature perk, you have Hatchling to work with Threadling-boosting fragments.

First-choice PvE roll for Stasis synergy in general activities. Shapeable. Our first Stasis Precision Bow, with competitive stats by comparison with the other kinetic slot options, although Accuracy is the lowest of all the Precisions. Your aim with the Bowstring and Arrow, as ever, is to reduce the draw time, while not harming your accuracy or handling. Elastic String is the best for as low a draw time as possible and helps Handling too, at the cost of Accuracy, which you can recover with an Accuracy Masterwork, while Compact Arrow Shaft boosts handling and reload speed. Don't forget, the Noble Deeds origin perk will also boost both as well. If you ever see Archer's Tempo as the support perk in the first trait column then you don't need to look much further.

// Round Robin PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Armor-Piercing Rounds, High-Caliber ROunds, Ricochet Rounds, Stay Away, Subsistence, Hatchling

First-choice PvE roll for Strand synergy in general content. Shapeable. Our first Strand Hand Cannon. Middling stats by comparison with other Aggressive Frames - prioritise handling and stability with your barrel and mag to improve gunfeel. You should be engaging enemies at a decent range so Keep Away boosts range, accuracy and reload speed, or Subsistence will keep your mag topped up. In the second trait column Hatchling spawns a Threadling on crit kills to play with, and lets you tap into Strand fragments, and the Nanotech Tracer Rockets add both damage and flinch when you proc them - really fun for PvE.

// Synchronic Roulette PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, High-Caliber Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Flared Magwell, Envious Assassin, Hatchling

First-choice PvE roll for Strand synergy in general content. Precision frame SMG, so you don't have to worry about recoil direction and range is pretty compressed, so go for handling and stability with your barrel. In the mag, High-Caliber Rounds is always good for extra flinch on a bullet hose, but Armor-Piercing is also decent for damaging multiple adds in CQC, Ricochet Rounds can be run or just get extra stability and Reload speed with Flared Magwell. There's not much PvE-wise in the first trait column - Envious Assassin is much better on a Special or Power weapon, but it's worth it for the occasional overfilled mag. In the second trait column Hatchling spawns a Threadling on rapid kills to play with, and lets you tap into Strand fragments, and the Nanotech Tracer Rockets add both damage and flinch when you proc them - really fun for PvE.

With one eye to Voltshot in the final column, you want reload speed as high as possible so Flared Magwell or Light Mag, and Compulsive Reloader or Keep Away with a Reload Speed Masterwork should get Voltshot procced and ready to use as quickly as possible after a kill.

First-choice PvE roll for burst damage in end-game activities. Sniper rifles are in a bit of a tough spot as v7.0.0.3, but it's worth holding on to a good roll or two in the Vault, just in case. If you're shaping one, Fluted Barrel makes it snappier, and you can bypass the reload speed penalty of Extended Barrel with Backup Mag and Envious Assassin, to overload your magazine of 5 to 8. In the second trait column on mouse and keyboard where stability isn't so much of an issue, so Cascade Point can use the kills that boosted your mag to dump them into a target in short order into a target for speedy burst damage. On top, the Nanotech Tracer Rockets add both damage and flinch when you proc them with multiple hits - really fun for PvE.

First-choice PvE roll for add clear in end-game activities. Shapeable. The first Compressed Wave Frame power-slot grenade launcher, so there's not really anything to compare against for the stats so we can say with absolute certainty that the stats are best in class, average and worst in class all at the same time. Blast Radius only affects the initial impact, not the width of the wave so use the barrel to boost velocity and handling. Out of the two options for the mag, High Velocity Rounds is always the better one, improving Reload Speed too. There's an abundance of options for PvE in the first trait column, but the best option is Envious Assassin, passively overflowing the magazine as you get primary and special weapon kills, and then in the second, as this is primarily for add clear, Chain Reaction turns every kill into a stasis explosion, extending the damage radius and adding chunk damage against beefier enemies nearby. On top, the Nanotech Tracer Rockets add both damage and flinch when you proc them with multiple hits - really fun for PvE.

First-choice PvE roll for sustained damage against bosses in end-game activities. The first Strand flavoured LMG as at v7.0.0.3 but unfortunately stats are low by comparison with other adaptive frames - but there's still a choice of very usable rolls. Chambered Compensator takes the recoil direction to a controllable 90 and adds some extra stability. For sustained damage in boss DPS phases, you're looking for a combination of Extended or Appended Mag, together with Envious Assassin to then overfill the magazine with primary and special weapon kills as you lead up to the damage phase, and Target Lock to rack up to 40% additional damage against a single target. On top, the Nanotech Tracer Rockets add both damage and flinch when you proc them with multiple hits - really fun for PvE.

If you're using this for add clear, any one of the combat effect rounds High-Caliber, Armor-Piercing or Ricochet Rounds will work in the mag, then a reload park like Feeding Frenzy, maybe Keep Away if you're not up to your neck in CQC adds, Pulse Monitor to refill the magazine when your shield's broken, or Envious Assassin to overfill the magazine before you start, should work nicely. In the second trait column, Hatchling should add additional damage through Threadline creation, or the first stack of Golden Tricorn will be a reliable 15% damage boost - you might have a little more work to do getting Strand ability kills but when you do, 50% bonus damage for 10s should rip through even the beefiest minors and occasional major.

// Disparity PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag, Rapid Hit, Outlaw, Headstone
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. Shapeable. First-choice PvE roll for synergy with Stasis subclasses. The Ambush origin trait is probably more for PvP than PvE, with the extra range, handling and 10% boost to damage for a few moments after combat starts, but Hakke Breach Armaments, with the additional damage against stasis crystals is the choice to break crystals for a dragonfly-like burst of damage. This is the only currentas at v6.3.0.2 me aggressive frame pulse rifle in the kinetic slot, so it's worth hanging on a good roll. Correct the wonky recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake, or Fluted Barrel makes it feel snappier and more stable. In the mag, Flared Magwell or Tactical Mag are the best options, adding more stability and reload speed. To match up with Headstone, Rapid Hit and Outlaw both proc on the same condition to reward consistent crits.

Correct the wonky recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake, or Fluted Barrel makes it feel snappier and more stable. In the mag, Flared Magwell or Tactical Mag are the best options, adding more stability and reload speed. Pugilist and Swashbuckler are the obvious choices for melee builds, but Frenzy has its place too to regenerate melee energy.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. First-choice PvE roll for end-game content. Shapeable. The Ambush origin trait is probably more for PvP than PvE, with the extra range, handling and 10% boost to damage for a few moments after combat starts or Omolon Fluid Dynamics' extra stability and reload speed is always welcome. An arc legendary trace rifle to complete the energy set. Stats are a bit of a mixed bag, but there are a few interesting rolls, and at least now you can collect them all! In use you'll be looking for a combination of a barrel that makes it feel snappier with additional handling or keeps recoil under control by improving the stability, together with a battery that provides some extra stability, reload speed, range or charge. There's a big enough battery to get your three shots to improve all the gunfeel stats with Stats for All, and boost damage by 35% with One for All - this should rip through chunkier adds in end-game content.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. First-choice PvE roll for general content. Shapeable. The Ambush origin trait is probably more for PvP than PvE, with the extra range, handling and 10% boost to damage for a few moments after combat starts, although Suros Synergy's flinch reduction in reload is useful in a firefight too so take your pick. This is better in every stat than the only other rapid fire LMG - Shattered Cypher - and there are a few ways you can go with a weapon build. You'll need to control your fire with short bursts - so, to make it easier, tighten up the recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake, or boost stability with your barrel perk. Add your choice of extra shots, stability and reload speed with the mag. For general add clear, use Stats for All, Field Prep, or Feeding Frenzy for maximum uptime in your first trait column, and the old favourite Rampage in the second to stack up to 33% bonus damage on kills.

// IKELOS_SMG_v1.0.3 PvE first-choice roll
// Full Bore, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Seraph Rounds, Threat Detector, Perpetual Motion, Surrounded
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. First-choice PvE roll for end-game add clear. Shapeable. It's already an S-Tier stat monster and the Rasputin's Arsenal origin trait reloads on a shield break, which should save on a few reloads. Not having to worry about stability as much, you might as well push out the range as far as you can for M&KB, and then with the combined goodness of Armor-Piercing, High-Caliber and Ricochet Rounds, Seraph Rounds is a clear first choice in the mag. If you're looking at end-game add-clearing, Threat Detector will speed up your reloads and boost your stability while you're in CQC or Perpetual Motion will do the same just for moving about a bit and Surrounded boosts damage by 36.5% and the enhanced version by 47%. But, even though this is a great roll, you'll still know in your heart that you really wanted Voltshot... Recommended  MW: Stability or Handling, with a damage-boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, pve-endgame, mkb

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. PvE first-choice roll for end-game Minor clearing. The only easily available Aggressive SMG in the game other than Xur selling an Extraordinary Rendition - you have a good one, you probably won't need a Cold Front. Option of Hakke Breach Armaments or the Dawning Surprise origin trait can help you gain ability energy and restart healing by collecting a small box after killing a half-dozen enemies or so. Very poor stability, but that's not so important for mouse and keyboard so you can go all in for range with the barrel with Full Bore or Hammer Forged Rifling, together with Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell for the boost to reload, or Appended Mag for the extra shots. For end-game add clear, the reliable SOFA combination of Stats for All and One for All rounds out the stats and adds 35% bonus damage just for hitting three different enemies.

// Jurassic Green PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Chambered Compensator, Polygonal Rifling, Smallbore, Armor-Piercing Rounds, High-Calibre Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Subsistence, Frenzy
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 37. PvE first-choice roll for general content. The Origin Trait, gaining better ADS and strafe speed when on your own, might be useful when you're away from your fireteam, but think of it more as a useful added extra when it's procced. Dreadful stats compared to any other energy rapid-fire pulse rifle as at v6.2.5.1, but it's the only solar one currently available. Wonky recoil direction of 50, so you'll need to straighten that out as much as possible with a Recoil Direction barrel, Stability Barrel or a bit of both.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 37. PvE first-choice roll for non-endgame content, particularly for solar subclasses. The Origin Trait, gaining better ADS and strafe speed when on your own, might be useful when you're away from your fireteam, but think of it more as a useful added extra when it's procced. Dreadful stats compared to any other energy rapid-fire pulse rifle as at v6.2.5.1, but it's the only solar one currently available. Wonky recoil direction of 50, so you'll need to straighten that out as much as possible with a Recoil Direction barrel, Stability Barrel or a bit of both. Take your choice of the combat-effect mag perks in your mag slot - any of them should work fine. Subsistence keeps your magazine topped up or Perpetual Motion boosts gunfeel stats passively. In the second column, Golden Tricorn provides a reliable 15% damage boost with one stack, or a full 50% at two stacks after a solar ability kill, or play with solar subclass scorch and ignite stacks with Incandescent.

@description:Festival of the Lost reprised weapons with the Search Party Origin trait, and primary and power weapons dropping from Dares of Eternity and the Grasp of Averice dungeon

// BrayTech Werewolf PvP first-choice roll
// Polygonal Rifling, Chambered Compensator, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Ricochet Rounds, Dynamic Sway Reduction, Tap the Trigger
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 280 with @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. The Origin Trait is aimed more at 3v3 game modes, where you're less likely to be near a team mate to gain the better ADS and strafe speed. A competitive subfamily TTK of 0.8s if you can hit 6 crits and 1 body shot, and a not-awful accuracy-adjusted TTK of 0.93s 4c, 4b as at v6.2.5. Decent stats within the subfamily. Ignore the recoil direction, as this is a precision frame, so you can use the barrel to fill in your favoured stat - this does have the lowest zoom of its peers so you can either try and compensate with range, or live with it and improve stability. Ricochet Rounds adds range and stability, and is your best mag choice. For duelling, you don't really need to look further than Dynamic Sway Reduction and Tap the Trigger which together add stability and accuracy through your volley. Recommended MW: Stability or Range, with a Quick Access Sling, Sprint Grip or Targeting Adjuster mod depending on your preference. tags:pvp, pvp-duel, pvp-god, mkb, controller

// Jurassic Green PvP first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Chambered Compensator, Polygonal Rifling, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Ricochet Rounds, Rangefinder, Golden Tricorn
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 280 with @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining, particularly for solar subclasses. The Origin Trait is aimed more at 3v3 game modes, where you're less likely to be near a team mate to gain the better ADS and strafe speed. Reasonably competitive out of the box with a subfamily TTK of 0.8s with 8 crits and 1 body shot, and an accuracy-adjusted TTK of 1.00s 7c, 3b which only needs the smallest of damage boosts to improve as at v6.2.5. Unfortunately, stats are pretty weak across the board - the 50 Recoil Direction and joint lowest zoom means that, even with a recoil direction-correcting or stability barrel, you'll will still probably find a Counterbalance mod necessary. You really need both more range and more stability, once you've sorted the recoil direction, so Ricochet Rounds are your best mag perk. In the first trait column, Rangefinder will help push out range with an extra point of zoom. The second trait column is a bit short on PvP picks, but Golden Tricorn is the most reliable damage perk. One stack after a kill drops TTK down to 0.73s 7c, 1b and accuracy-adjusted TTK to 0.8s 5c, 4b. If you manage to proc both stacks, this drops further to a lightning-fast TTK of 0.47s 6c or an accuracy-adjusted TTK of 0.67s 4c, 3b. Recommended MW: Stability, with a Counterbalance mod. tags:pvp, pvp-chain, pvp-god, mkb, controller

// Mechabre PvP first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Alloy Mag, Snapshot Sights, Opening Shot
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 280 with @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. The Origin Trait is aimed more at 3v3 game modes, where you're less likely to be near a team mate to gain the better ADS and strafe speed - this should help with sniping too. For snipers you generally want to boost Handling with the barrel. In the mag, there's not an awful lot to help out, but Alloy Mag is probably your best pick to help with reloads after you've emptied the mag. For most people Snapshot Sights and Opening Shot is the best trait combination, getting you into the very reasonable ADS zoom of 45 quickly, adds 20 Aim Assistance and boosts accuracy.

// Fluted Barrel, Extended Mag, Snapshot Sights, Opening Shot
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 280 with @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvP pick for solar Warlock Heat Rises AC-130 build in-air duelling. The Origin Trait is aimed more at 3v3 game modes, where you're less likely to be near a team mate to gain the better ADS and strafe speed - this should help with sniping too. For snipers you generally want to boost Handling with the barrel. For an Airborne Effectiveness build, Extended Mag adds 10, and Snapshot Sights and Opening Shot together gets you into the very reasonable ADS zoom of 45 quickly, adds 20 Aim Assistance and boosts accuracy. You will probably need some additional help from an exotic to really make this useful, but it's an option.

// Fluted Barrel, Extended Mag, Auto-Loading Holster, Opening Shot
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 280 with @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvP pick for solar Warlock Heat Rises AC-130 build in-air duelling. The Origin Trait is aimed more at 3v3 game modes, where you're less likely to be near a team mate to gain the better ADS and strafe speed - this should help with sniping too. For snipers you generally want to boost Handling with the barrel. For an Airborne Effectiveness build, Extended Mag adds 10, Auto-Loading Holster bypasses the reload speed penalty and Opening Shot adds 20 Aim Assistance and boosts accuracy.

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 279 with @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. Shapeable.

Good all-round stats within the subfamily.

// Matador 64 PvP first-choice roll
// Barrel Shroud, Full Choke, Accurized Rounds, Perpetual Motion, Threat Detector, Opening Shot
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 279 with @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. This is a precision pellet not slug shotgun with decent baseline stats, but the subfamily is weaker than lightweights, still needing 11 out of 12 pellets to hit for a guaranteed kill, but with a slower fire rate.

// Matador 64 PvP first-choice roll
// Barrel Shroud, Full Choke, Assault Mag, Perpetual Motion, Threat Detector, Opening Shot
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 279 with @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvP pick for duelling. This is a precision pellet not slug shotgun with decent baseline stats, but the subfamily is weaker than lightweights, still needing 11 out of 12 pellets to hit for a guaranteed kill, but with a slower fire rate. Barrel Shroud improves the handling, or Full Choke keeps the pellets a little tighter, a Range Masterwork and Opening Shot together boost range to 100 for a 7m damage falloff distance, Assault Mag makes follow-up shots a little faster, and in the first trait column either Threat Detector or Perpetual Motion passively boost handling.

// Smallbore, Tactical Battery, Well-Rounded, Perpetual Motion, Golden Tricorn
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 279 with @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvP pick for kill-chaining, particularly with a solar subclass. Shapeable. The Hot Swap origin trait works well for PvP, boosting handling when swapping to the weapon while damaged for quick swaps and ADS speed. Great stats - standard for trace rifles, but not quite as good as Hollow Denial. Difficult to work out what role it plays in the sandbox, effectively being a very accurate high ROF auto rifle that uses special ammo. The base accuracy-adjusted TTK is 0.8s wth 8 crits and 5 body shots, but small damage buffs do make it easier to use - Golden Tricorn x1 or Radiant get you to 0.73s TTK in 5 crits and 7 bodies, and if you can get Golden Tricorn x2 up and have enough battery charge left, you can get an Accuracy-Adjusted TTK of 0.53s with 5 crits and 4 bodies. Choose a barrel that doesn't have any penalties and Tactical Battery provides a range of small gunfeel stat boosts. In the first trait column, Well-Rounded or Perpetual Motion both help further with gunfeel stats and, in the second, Golden Tricorn is the best damage boost for PvP.

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast Versus Enemies episode 48 with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for melee builds. The Bray Inheritance trait is really useful for PvE, returning from 0.46% to 2% ability energy from hits the amount depends on the weapon archetype. Good stats by comparison with other rapid-fire scouts, and there are a couple of ways to go with your roll. The first thing to do is sort out the recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake, which also helps handling a bit. Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell add stability and reload speed and an extra bullet for Tac Mag. For melee builds, Pugilist and Swashbuckler are the natural choice - get a melee kill for a refreshable 33% damage boost, and then each hit regenerates a little melee energy from the origin trait, while each kill regenerates a full 10%.

// Commemoration PvE first-choice roll
// // Arrowhead Brake, Chambered Compensator, Extended Barrel, Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Extended Mag, Flared Magwell, Alloy Mag, Dragonfly, Killing Tally
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast Versus Enemies episode 48 with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for add clear in end-game activities. The Bray Inheritance trait is really useful for PvE, returning from 0.46% to 2% ability energy from hits the amount depends on the weapon archetype. Good stats and a stellar PvE perk pool make this an LMG worth chasing. You can choose to sort the recoil with Arrowhead Brake, Chambered Compensator or Extended Barrel, or improve stability with Fluted Barrel or Polygonal Rifling. Most mag choices could have a role - boost your magazine size with Appended or Extended Mag, reload speed with Flared Magwell or Alloy Mag, or both with Tactical Mag. For a fun add-clear option in crowds, pair Dragonfly with Killing Tally. Recommended MW: Handling, with a Backup Mag, or damage-boosting Major, Boss or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, controller, mkb

// Bequest PvE first-choice roll
// Jagged Edge, Swordmaster's Guard, Unrelenting, Chain Reaction
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast Versus Enemies episode 48 with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE roll for add clear in end-game activities. The Bray Inheritance trait is really useful for PvE, returning from 0.46% to 2% ability energy from hits the amount depends on the weapon archetype. The standout stat here is impact, which is 10 points higher than for any other adaptive sword, which makes it competitive in end-game content for chunkier adds. Jagged Edge adds more damage and Swordmaster's Guard increases you heavy attack charge rate. For add clear, Unrelenting keeps your health up while Chain Reaction helps clear crowds, with kills counting towards Unrelenting too. Recommended MW: Impact, with a Backup Mag, or damage-boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, controller, mkb

title:King's Fall Raid PvP weapon picks with illPhysics
description:Reprised King's Fall weapons with Runneth Over origin trait

// Doom of Chelchis PvP first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Flared Magwell, Explosive Payload, Eye Of The Storm
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 277 with @illPhysics. Shapeable.  First-choice PvP pick for duelling on larger maps. Not that great as a subfamily in PvP, in un-perked form, but very responsive to any damage buff - Radiant, Empowering Rift and High Energy Fire mean you can achieve a 3-crit kill in 0.67s against any resilience, as at v6.2.0.7. Doom has lower stability and zoom than comparators - this helps with your sight picture, but means the recoil isn't constrained quite as much. It should still be fairly easily controllable, so you can spec into Handling, and maybe a little bit of reload in your barrel and mag. For duelling, Explosive Payload at 180 RPM and Eye of the Storm has the potential to really irritate opponents at the same time as making crit shots easier to hit in a firefight. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a Radar Tuner to help you stay aware of your surroundings if hardscoping, Quick Access Sling or Sprint Grip mod depending on your preference. tags:pvp, pvp-duel, pvp-god, mkb, controller

// Smite of Merain PvP first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag, Moving Target, Eye Of The Storm
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 277 with @illPhysics. Shapeable. First-choice PvP pick for duelling.

The lower zoom of 17 means you have a more open sight picture than other adaptive pulse rifles, but also means the recoil is less constrained too, so first choice in the barrel is Arrowhead Brake, which brings Recoil Direction to 100, and improves Handling. Flared Magwell or Tactical Mag adds some Stability and Reload Speed, and then for duelling Moving Target and Eye Of The Storm make hitting those crits easier in a gunfight.

Stats are on the low side, including a truly terrible Recoil Direction of 50, so you will need a Counterbalance mod even with Arrowhead Brake, but you'll also benefit from its reduction of 30 bounce intensity, so it's still the best barrel park. With the mag, Ricochet Rounds or Flared Magwell round out the stats, adding some needed Stability. For a duelling roll, look for Perpetual Motion and Eye of the Storm to keep your reticule on target and make your crits easier to hit in a gunfight.

As will all playlist weapons, the more reputation resets you can get, the more trait options you'll get to play with, otherwise you've only got a 1/144 chance of any pair of traits dropping, before you even look at barrel, mag and masterwork, although at least 50% of them are good PvP traits, which makes getting a usable roll a little easier. You have access to an excellent PvP origin perk for SMGs in Omolon Fluid Dynamics, in a solid SMG subfamily, needing only the smallest of damage buffs to go from a TTK of 0.67s with 11 crits and 1 body, to a 0.6s 8 crit, 2 body kill. Stats are on the low side, and with a Zoom of only 14, you'll never compete with a range specced Multimach or Shayura's, so focus on making this as good a CQC SMG as you're likely to meet. Add as much Handling and Stability as you can with barrel and mag so you can keep the reticule on target for crits. For a duelling roll, it's not really necessary to look further than Dynamic Sway Reduction in the first trait column - pair this with the Omolon origin trait and Tap the Trigger and you'll end up with a precision bullet hose no matter where you are in the magazine.

// Hung Jury SR4 PvP first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Steady Roads, Rapid Hit, Box Breathing
//notes:First choice PvP roll for duelling. Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with @DefyFly. The main draw for Hung Jury as at v6.2.0.6 is Box Breathing in the second trait column, which means you can three tap any resilience 2 Crit + 1 Body of a 0.67s TTK and two tap tap lower resiliences, as at Season 18 v6.2.0.6. To proc it though, you need to almost treat the weapon like it needs pre-charging by ADS-ing before an ancounter, It goes without saying, you need to land crits and stay mobile. You don't need extra range, so focus on Handling and Stability with your barrel and mag. Rapid Hit in the first trait column helps further with Stability as well as a Reload Speed boost Recommended MW: Handling, with a Full Auto Retrofit mod, Radar Tuner to help you stay aware of your surroundings if hardscoping, Quick Access Sling or Sprint Grip mod depending on your preference. tags:pvp, pvp-duel, pvp-god, mkb, controller

// Staccato-46 PvP first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Steady Rounds, Outlaw, Rampage
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with @DefyFly. First choice PvP roll for kill-chaining. You don't need extra range, so focus on Handling and Stability with your barrel and mag. Outlaw is probably your best first trait column perk, but it does stack well with Rampage anyway, one stack of which with Radiant or in an Empowering Rift sorry Titans, gets you a 0.67s TTK against any resilience, with two crits and a body, as at Season 18 v6.2.0.6, on anyone within a 70m radius of you.

// Servant Leader PvP first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Steady Rounds, Tunnel Vision, Rapid Hit, Kill Clip
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with @DefyFly. First choice PvP roll for kill-chaining. Drops from Gambit, so reset your reputation as many times as you have patience for first, to maximise the trait options from decrypting engrams. You don't need extra range,  and the high base zoom 26 means you can control the recoil with Stability, and not worry about Recoil Direction, in your barrel and mag. Kill Clip, in the second trait column, reduces the TTK to a competitive 0.7s 3 crits, 1 body, as at Season 18 v6.2.0.6, and you can pair this with Tunnel Vision or Rapid Hit, both of which will work well.

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with @DefyFly. First choice PvP roll for kill-chaining. You don't need extra range, so choose between Fluted Barrel for Handling or Polygonal Rifling for pure Stability or maybe Arrowhead Brake if you find the Recoil Direction needs taming, and add more Stability with Steady Rounds in the mag. Kill Clip, in the second trait column, reduces the TTK to a competitive 0.7s 3 crits, 1 body, as at Season 18 v6.2.0.6, and you can pair this with Tunnel Vision which procs on the same condition and makes your follow-up kills easier.

Recommended MW: Reload Speed, with a Radar Tuner to help you stay aware of your surroundings when hardscoping, Quick Access Sling or Sprint Grip mod depending on your preference. tags:pvp, pvp-chain, pvp-god, mkb, controller

// Pure Poetry PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Appended Mag, Perpetual Motion, Ensemble, Fourth Time's the Charm, Outlaw, Rampage
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for general content. Drops from Vanguard activities, so reset your reputation as many times as you have patience for first, to maximise the trait options from decrypting engrams. Maybe not meta as at S18 v6.2.0.6, but Aggressive Frame HCs are always handy for bounties or patrols that call for crit kills, anyway. Good stats overall, slow firing, so stability is less important, so add Handling with Fluted Barrel and add a few extra bullets with Appended Mag. Rampage is a reliable damage boost in the second trait column in general, at-level content, paired with a first column trait to boost reload or to keep the shots coming, should keep the kil streak going. Recommended MW: Stability or Handling, with a damage-boosting Minor, Major or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, controller, mkb

// Pizzicato-22 PvE first-choice roll
// Extended Barrel, Ricochel Rounds, Perpetual Motion, Ensemble, Multikill Clip
//notes:PvE first-choice roll for general content. Good overall stats, but has 1 less point of Zoom than its competitors, so you might need to add a little extra range to make up for that with the barrel and mag choices - Extended Barrel does this and take the Recoil Direction to a maximum 100. Ricochet Rounds then pushes Range out by a total of about 1.25m, and smooths things with a dab of Stability too. To make the most of Multikill Clip, you need to spend as little time reloading as possible - Perpetual Motion anywhere or Ensemble in a fireteam both help with this.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for end-game content, particularly with a solar burn. Shapeable. Good stats by comparison with other energy Precision frame ARs. Focus on Handling or Stability in the barrel, as with the Precision Frame you don't need to worry about Recoil Direction, and any mag perk will do depending on your preferences, except maybe Alloy Mag and Extended Mag. For end-game content, a SOFA Stats/One For All boosts gunfeel stats and adds 35% damage for the cost of a three shots from your 32 shot magazine.

title:Season of Plunder PvP weapon picks with Gleaux
description:Season 18 weapons with Right Hook origin perk

// Tarnished Mettle PvP first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Polygonal Rifling, Chambered Compensator, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Steady Rounds, Moving Target, Eye of the Storm, Explosive Payload
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with Gleaux. Not a great TTK as at v6.2.0.6, and the Origin Perk is really aimed at CQC, so won't be much use. Shapeable. In-band stats except for the high Airborne Effectiveness if you wanted to jump shoot with a Scout!. The lethality perks are difficult to proc to a level where they make any meaningful difference, so aim to shape yourself something close a legendary MIDA for duelling. You can either help sort out the wonky Recoil Direction with Arrowhead Brake, or look to add stability with your barrel. You don't really need to worry about range, so Steady Rounds gives you even more stability and increases AE to 25. A Targeting mod or two on your helmet and Enhanced Moving Target can get you close to 100 Aim Assistance. Finally Enhanced Eye of the Storm just makes landing crits in combat easier or Explosive Payload crits at 200RPM can seriously mess with an opponent's day.  Recommended MW: Stability or Handling, with a Sprint Grip, Quick Access Sling, Freehand Grip or Icarus Grip if you're serious about aerial use mod depending on your preference. tags:pvp, pvp-god, pvp-duel, controller, mkb

// Blood Feud PvP first-choice roll
// Hammer-Forged Rifling, Accurized Rounds, Dynamic Sway Reducation, Elemental Capacitor
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with Gleaux. The Origin Perk is really aimed at CQC, so should be useful here, and the accuracy-adjusted time to kill is competitive, but this is difficult to recommend over Ikelos or Borrowed Time which both have better base stats. Shapeable. If you are going to shape one for duelling, to tuck away just in case, you might as well add to range with barrel and mag, and then make it more controllable with Dynamic Sway Reduction and Elemental Capacitor with a Void subclass. Recommended MW: Stability or Range, with a Freehand Grip, Quick Access Sling, or Sprint Grip mod depending on your preference. tags:pvp, pvp-god, pvp-duel, controller, mkb

Shapeable. If you are going to shape one for kill-chaining, to tuck away just in case, just lean into CQC and add as much stability as you can with barrel and mag and then take advantage of the synergy between Pugilist and Swashbuckler - this could work well on Stasis classes using abilities to freeze and then melee an opponent also proccing the origin trait to go on a tear with fully-procced Swashbuckler, and additionally building into Font of Might on your armour mods for even more damage.

// Brigand's Law PvP first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Smallbore, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Accurized Rounds, Hip-Fire Grip, Threat Detector, Perpetual Motion, Swashbuckler, Surrounded
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with Gleaux. The Origin Perk is aimed at CQC, so should be useful here. Shapeable. Rapid-fire sidearms have competitive TTK as at v6.2.0.6, and the stats compare well in the slot but it's hard to look past Drang if you're thinking about energy sidearms. Range is really constrained in sidearms, so you could add an extra 0.75m or boost handling or stability with your barrel and mag. With the traits, lean into an aggressive playstyle and shape a kill-chaining weapon with Hip-Fire Grip to improve hip-fire performance, or Threat Detector or Perpetual Motion to add to your gunfeel stats in the first trait column, and your choice of Swashbuckler or Surrounded, both of which can reduce your TTK dramatically when fully procced in the second.

// No Reprieve PvP first-choice roll
// Full Bore, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Accurized Rounds, Pugilist, Headstone
//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 275 conversation with Gleaux. The Origin Perk is aimed at CQC, so should be useful here. Shapeable. Excellent first-choice slug-shottie, particularly for Stasis subclasses who can use an Aspect to create Stasis shards, and Fragments to use those to regain melee and grenade energy or for Damage Reduction. Go for range with your barrel and mag. Then, as this is a CQC weapon, Pugilist is the best option for the first trait column, and  Headstone gives you all the stasis good stuff in the second and, as a bonus in Comp or Trials, prevents revives while the crystal persists.

// Arrowhead Brake, Polygonal Rifling, Chambered Compensator, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Extended Barrel, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Pugilist, Swashbuckler
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for melee builds in general content. Shapeable. The Origin Perk is aimed at playing with a fireteam - the larger, the better your magazine size after reload will be. Excellent in-slot stats and a great perk pool will give probably give you crafting headaches to shape and level all the rolls you might want! Arrowhead Brake will straighten up the recoil direction, but to be honest you could go with boosts to stability or handling instead. Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell help with stability and reload speed. For melee-focused builds, the combination of Pugilist and Swashbuckler are the obvious matching traits to choose.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for grenade builds in general content. Shapeable. The Origin Perk is aimed at playing with a fireteam - the larger, the better your magazine size after reload will be. Excellent in-slot stats and a great perk pool will give probably give you crafting headaches to shape and level all the rolls you might want! Arrowhead Brake will straighten up the recoil direction, but to be honest you could go with boosts to stability or handling instead. Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell help with stability and reload speed. For grenade-focused builds, the combination of Demolitionist and Adrenaline Junkie are the obvious matching traits to choose.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for Solar subclasses in general content. Shapeable. The Origin Perk is aimed at playing with a fireteam - the larger, the better your magazine size after reload will be. Good in-slot stats and a great perk pool will give probably give you crafting headaches to shape and level all the rolls you might want! Use the barrel to round out your preferred Range/ Stability/ Handling stat, and then you want as many bullets in the mag as possible with Tactical Mag or Appended Mag plus the Backup Mag mod, to help with the origin trait boost. Then, to synergise with Solar subclasses, you can craft a mini-Sunshot by taking Explosive Payload for additional flinch, damage and utility against Overload Champions, together with Incandescent for your scorch and ignite explosion chaining.

// Zaouli's Bane PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Explosive Payload, Ensemble, Incandescent
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE first-choice roll for Solar subclasses in general content. Shapeable. The Origin Perk is aimed at playing with a fireteam - the larger, the better your magazine size after reload will be. Good in-slot stats and a great perk pool will give probably give you crafting headaches to shape and level all the rolls you might want! Use the barrel to round out your preferred Range/ Stability/ Handling stat, and then you want as many bullets in the mag as possible with Tactical Mag or Appended Mag plus the Backup Mag mod, to help with the origin trait boost. Then, to synergise with Solar subclasses, you can craft a mini-Sunshot by taking Ensemble for the faster reload and handling in a fireteam, building into the origin trait, together with Incandescent for your scorch and ignite explosion chaining.

Any of the recoil direction barrels will get you to the maximum 100, and Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell add Stability and Reload Speed. A combination of Pugilist and Wellspring gets your melee energy back as soon as is possible.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 31. PvE first-choice roll for Arc 3.0 builds in general content. The Origin Perk works well in CQC, so isn't very useful for a Scout Rifle. Arrowhead Brake cleans up the recoil direction, and either Tactical Mag or Flared Magwell help with both stability and Reload Speed. You can use demolitionist to help ability regen or Fourth Time's The Charm and Rapid Hit help keep the bullets coming, and Voltshot is the new hotness for Arc 3.0 builds as of Season 18.

// Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Assault Mag, Tactical Mag, Pugilist, Swashbuckler, Wellspring
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 31. PvE first-choice roll for melee builds in general content. The Origin Perk works well in CQC, and in particular for melee-heavy playstyles. High-ish stats make this fairly competitive in slot if you don't look too closely at Heritage, anyway. You can never go wrong with a bit more range from your barrel, and faster fire rate, or an extra round in the mag and better reload speed. You can turn this into a great melee support option with Pugilist and Wellspring for ability regen or Swashbuckler for damage output.

// Stay Frosty PvE first-choice roll
// Full Bore, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds, Appended Mag, Enlightened Action, Collective Action
//notes: Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 91 https://open.spotify.com/episode/50NPk7xF3Tt6X3DVucE9jU?si=44d2b7d44a5a4aec with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in general content, particularly with a Stasis subclass. Like most world-drop weapons, Stay Frosty has pretty low stats by comparison to its subtype peers, so only keep a roll if it fills a gap in your vault. The recoil direction is directly up if a bit loose at 55, and if you're comfortable with this - p[articularly with M+KB, you could look to boost the range with your barrel perk. For the mag perk, choose between Tactical Mag, Accurized Rounds and Appended Mag for additional stat boosts. There's not much for PvE in the first trait column - Enlightened Action provides some nice reload speed and handling boosts is the best support perk available. If you're running a Stasis subclass, Stasis shards should be pretty easy to generate for Collective Action to use for a 20% damage boost for 7s although you can interact with any elemental drop. The Dawning Surprise origin trait is very useful in PvE - when the behind the scenes counter hits 100, the surprise is spawned on the ground for 10s and grants 10% energy to all abilities, grants 20HP and starts shield/health regeneration. Recommended MW: Stability, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-god, mkb

// Nightshade PvE first-choice roll
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 78 https://open.spotify.com/episode/5KOQQ9QtvSEhRVb4vjeO3B?si=8c4784e02b87424e with @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for Strand synergy and add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in general content. Nightshade is back - the same lightweight frame as in vanilla D2, which now gives you +20 Mobility and +6.25% to movement speed, but this time as a Strand weapon. The stats are solid by comparison with other kinetic options. On M&KB, start with pushing the range out with Full Bore, and then add one of the combat effect rounds - they are all useful and add more range. In the first trait column as the support park, either Enlightened Action boosts reload speed and handling to maximum in two 3-round bursts, or Outlaw maximises reload and applies a scalar. To pair with this in the second column signature slot, Collective Action boosts damage by 20% for 7s on an Elemental Pickup, or Kill Clip adds 25% damage for 5s after a precision kill. The Nadir Focus Origin Trait adding range and accuracy on repeated hits isn't game-changing, but it is nice to have.

First-choice PvE pick for add-clear use in general activities. Shapeable. Transfiguration is the only obtainable high-impact scout rifle available as at S21, plus it has a solid set of stats, although reload is a bit slow. With less need to worry about stability on M+KB, you can go all into range with Full Bore and get an extra 2.5m from base. Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell are the pick of the magazine perks, adding useful reload speed, a bit of stability and an extra shot for Tac Mag. This is the only scout rifle you can roll with Rampage and Kill Clip together which, when procced together, add 66.4% damage - possibly one that's more for memes, but it could still be fun.

// Polygonal Rifling, Smallbore, Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Accurized Rounds, Ambitious Assassin, Headstone
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 31. PvE backup roll for Stasis subclasses in general content. The Origin Perk works well in CQC, and in particular for melee-heavy playstyles. Increasing stability will make the recoil easier to control, and Accurized Rounds pushes range out by a metre or so. Ambitious Assassin boosts magazine size for creating stasis crystals with Headstone.

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 264 conversation with @pattycakesGG. PvP first-choice A-Tier roll for kill-chaining. Not obtainable as at S17, unfortunately, but even after the Zoom nerf it's still very good. Push out range and zoom as far as you can with your sight, mag and Masterwork. Killing Wind adds useful stat boosts including range after a kill and Iron Reach passively extends the range still further, albeit at the expense of stability.

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 264 conversation with @pattycakesGG. PvP first-choice A-Tier roll for duelling. The reprised version rolls with barrels rather than sights, which limits your maximum range, but this has new perks than can help make that back up.

Fragile Focus can help boost initial range in an engagement, until you take damage, and Iron Reach provides a big range boost, albeit at the cost of stability.

Generally; [Quick/Hard Launch / Spike/Blinding / Surplush/Slideshot/Ambitious / Vorpal/Demolitionist/Frenzy]. Ultimately, this is a fantastic gun, and the rolls are mostly personal preference. There's a lot of fuss over Slideshot, but you may ultimately decide it doesn't fit your playstyle - my personal recommendation is Surplus, as it feels a lot better to get into the reload-shoot rhythm to me. Slideshot for PvP, however." tags:pve-god, pvp-god

// Extraordinary Rendition - [YeezyGT's S15] PvE / PvP: god-pve,god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] PvE / PvP: [MW: Stability / Reload / Range] "A personal favourite. For PvE, invest in; [Stability / Reload / Subsistence/Overflow / Rampage/Frenzy]. For PvP, invest in; [Surplus / Multikill Clip]. After IKELOS_SMG, this is likely the best 750RPM - and it definitely sounds like it. Subsistence is insanely strong on SMGs post-Primary changes, and Frenzy gives the perfect reload buff that SMGs direly need in PvE. In PvP, this is a strong contender, and up there as one of the best Legendary options, after Multimach in the same slot." tags:pve-god, pvp-god

// Empty Vessel - [YeezyGT's S15] PvE: god-pve,pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] PvE/PvP: [MW: Velocity] "God, this thing rocks. Not only does the little burst of flame on the explosion feel cool, the perk pool on it has insane potential. As always, Quick/Hard Launch, Spike +30% dmg or Blinding utility. If you roll Auto-Loading Holster, congratulations. If not, Surplus is very good - and Quickdraw is fantastic for PvP / clutching with Blinding Grenades in GMs. Disruption Break is fantastic in PvP if you want to be that guy, but a bit more situational for PvE. If you wanted Demolitionist here, I'd probably redirect you to Our Lord and Savior Salvager's Salvo." tags:pve-god, pvp

//notes: A unique GL, in that every single shot proc’s Chill Clip and applies 50 stacks of slow. Slow one enemy with a direct hit, and blind everyone around it with Blinding nades. Note that Chill Clip does not proc at all if Ambitious Assassin is the chosen perk, so avoid it and Proximity Nades Which prevent the grenade from direct hitting at all if you want to freeze enemies. tags:pvp-god, pve

They are instant-use, renewable portable shields, with a low skill floor and high skill ceiling. They're built around mid-health single-target cleanup, ranged instant kills, re-directing enemy aggro, and at worst, mitigating the consequences of poor gameplay decisions. Build into maximum Handling, with Impulse Amplifier being non-negotiable." tags:god-pve tags:pve-god

// Doom of Chelchis Harrowed - [YeezyGT's S18] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S18] [MW: Handling] "Doom of Chelchis chell-chiss or kell-kiss? is the does-it-all Scout Rifle. Explo/Frenzy. Adaptive Munitions. Firefly/Dragonfly. It shoots bad guys. It does your taxes. It looks phenomenal. Adaptive Munitions is incredibly strong for Match Game, and with how often Anti-Barrier Scout pops up, it's very valuable here. The 180RPM frame is familiar and well-loved, its stat package is great, and its got unconventional perk combos. It's probably better than my beloved Vouchsafe. I won't definitively admit it, but the sentiment is out there. Fantastic weapon." tags:god-pve tags:pve-god

// Doom of Chelchis - [YeezyGT's S18] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S18] [MW: Handling] "Doom of Chelchis chell-chiss or kell-kiss? is the does-it-all Scout Rifle. Explo/Frenzy. Adaptive Munitions. Firefly/Dragonfly. It shoots bad guys. It does your taxes. It looks phenomenal. Adaptive Munitions is incredibly strong for Match Game, and with how often Anti-Barrier Scout pops up, it's very valuable here. The 180RPM frame is familiar and well-loved, its stat package is great, and its got unconventional perk combos. It's probably better than my beloved Vouchsafe. I won't definitively admit it, but the sentiment is out there. Fantastic weapon." tags:god-pve tags:pve-god

// CALUS Mini-Tool - [YeezyGT's S18]  god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S18] [MW: Reload] "Mini-Tool is back and it's fantastic. Enhanced Surrounded +Spec is a truly whopping 47% damage buff, Threat Detector remains one of if not the best perks for SMGs, and Unrelenting post-buff is very, very good - especially when paired with a perk like Incandescent, which covers multiple enemies at once." tags:god-pve tags:pve-god

// The Enigma - [YeezyGT's S18] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S18] [MW: Handling] "Glaives are not what you think they are. Glaives are not melee weapons. They are instant-use, renewable portable shields, with a low skill floor and high skill ceiling. They're built around mid-health single-target cleanup, ranged instant kills, re-directing enemy aggro, and at worst, mitigating the consequences of poor gameplay decisions. Build into maximum Handling, with Impulse Amplifier being non-negotiable." tags:god-pve tags:pve-god

// Riptide - [YeezyGT's S18]  god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S18] [MW: Charge/Stab] "As of now, Riptide is probably the best Chill Clip workhorse in the game. Deliverance has great synergy with grenade-based Stasis builds, but Riptide is class-agnostic, sporting Auto-Loading Holster, easy-to-get, and can fire four 4! Chill Clip rounds using the default mag size. That's two separate freezes on a Rapid-Fire frame. You can shoot a rocket, swap to Riptide, and freeze a Barrier Champion in a Grandmaster before it even pulls up its shield. If the icon wasn't so abrasive, it'd probably never leave my inventory." tags:god-pve tags:pve-god

//notes: [YeezyGT's S18] [MW: Charge] "Stormchaser still reigns as one of the best-in-slot options, currently being the only burst-fire frame, and making up DPS potential with fast reload options such as Rapid Hit/Frenzy. There's a roll for everyone - Auto-Loading Holster, Clown Cartridge, Firing Line, Frenzy/Vorpal for solo activities - all sorts. It's well-loved, and well-loved for a reason." tags:god-pve tags:pve-god

// Avalanche - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Stability] "Avalanche rolls with the tried-and-true combo of Extended Mag/Auto-Loading/Damage perk. Opt for Swashbuckler/Adrenaline for most content, Vorpal for higher-end, and Dragonfly if you've got a very high Stability roll that feels stable enough to reliably hit headshots. Avalanche kicks quite a bit on Console, but the damage it puts out once it gets going is fairly devastating to waves of enemies." tags:pve-god

// Eyasluna - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] "Eyasluna is utterly fantastic. There are so many viable rolls on this that your best bet is to just go out and try them - what works for you may be completely different to everyone else. If you want some guidance; Col. 2: [Ricochet for stats, High-Cal/Armor Piercing for flinch], Col. 3: [Rangefinder for Zoom, Perpetual for constant buffs, Rapid Hit for ensuring you win the fights you start], Col 4: [Headstone for Stasis, Kill Clip for slaying in sixes, Moving Target for Aim Assist]. This is probably the easiest gun farm we've ever had, and for a great variable Hand Cannon that you can build to your preference. Give it a go." tags:pvp-god

// The Palindrome - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] "Palindrome's a household name. While the PvP-oriented perk selection is fairly small, the ones that it rolls with have transformed the Hand Cannon meta ever since their introduction. Typically you'll run Quickdraw/Killing Wind with Rangefinder/Rampage depending on your playstyle. I've seen a number of people using Thresh to great effect in sixes, also." tags:pvp-god

// Falling Guillotine - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Impact] "The even-edgier Dark Drinker. Post-Whirlwind nerfs, there's a real case for having a Surrounded version of this tucked away - with Surrounded Spec, it goes up to +35% instantly, with a 2s lingering buff after no longer being near enemies. It's enough to just about one-shot stunned Unstoppable Phalanxes in Legend-level content, using Jagged Edge. Whirlwind is still very strong for sustained DPS phases, just not as good as it once was -- Guillotine doesn't have an option to slot Vorpal, so its essentially down to "Will there be enemies in this encounter, or just the boss to focus on?"" tags:pve-god

// Found Verdict Timelost - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling/Range] "Dubbed by many as the greatest Shotgun in the game. Fantastic stat package, top-tier perks, farmable, and the Adept version can just slot the best mods in the game free of charge. Post-pellet changes, aim for Full Choke and Opening Shot. Frenzy has been said to make a difference in the engagements where you'd normally "ghost hit" someone to leave them one-shot." tags:pvp-god

// Hung Jury SR4 Adept - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Any] "Hung Jury is a fantastic option for high-end content, rivalled in-slot primarily by Night Watch. It really comes down to personal preference - in general, Explosive Rounds on a Scout Rifle is fantastic, Rapid Hit is fantastic, Subsistence is fantastic... Hung Jury's a great workhorse and it can't really steer you wrong. Even on the Adept, I appreciate having a few more bullets in the mag with Backup Mag as I've always been an Overflow Night Watch guy." tags:pve-god

// Vision of Confluence Timelost - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Any] "D2's Vision of Confluence was designed with Anti-Barrier Scout in mind. Rewind Rounds refunds on Barrier Shields, Disruption Break triggers on breaking them, and the gun is just a very strong endgame Primary in general. Due to how these Scouts are balanced, it doesn't see a lot of use outside of endgame, but if that were to change one day, Vision has a stellar perk pool for general use." tags:pve-god

// Uzume RR4 Adept - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Handling] "Uzume has a few PvE options in; Snapshot for general use, Clown Cartridge/Triple Tap for extended damage. Explosive Payload should be your go-to here, with the exception of if you're running Triple Tap / using against Barrier champs, then you should look at Vorpal. Or if you simply don't like Explosive Payload, Vorpal's the play. Invest into a Handling barrel if you're not running Snapshot, and prioritise keeping the magazine high if you're running Triple Tap/Clown Cartridge." tags:pve-god

// Occluded Finality - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling/Range] "We've been so used to 45 Zoom in D2 for so long, that Occluded Finality's 58 feels like you've accidentally equipped a telescope. It's a completely different set of disciplines you need to practice when using Occluded - you need to be certain that the lane you're peeking is where the action will be, as if you're wrong, you're likely blindsided when ADS'd. That's the trade off for the extra-generous Zoom allowing you to pick out every pixel of your enemy's helmet. Stick with Snapshot, Opening Shot is strong as always, Eye of the Storm is great when being flinched out of your binoculars." tags:pvp-god

// One Small Step - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling] "Primarily used as one of the perfect-roll One-Two Punch Shotguns. Invest highly into Handling, then Auto-Loading Holster / One-Two Punch are your go-to here. Full Choke strongly, strongly recommended for the above. Outside of OTP builds, you can do some interesting stuff with Trench Barrel to try and mimic the efficacy of the IKELOS_SG, but in the Kinetic slot." tags:pve-god

// IKELOS_SG_v1.0.2 - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Reload] What a weapon. Pellet shotties got a 10% PvE buff at the tail-end of Season 15, and it does feel noticeable in practice, especially when spraying down yellow bars or Fallen Walkers with shot-after-shot-after-shot from a Rapid-Fire Frame. Threat Detector is an S-Tier choice. Surrounded is made for this weapon. Vorpal is a great backup. Trench Barrel comes in at +50% - if you can remember to melee-stompcancel, you will chew through that enemy. Also: Warmind Cells. Run Fireteam Medic and you become unstoppable." tags:pve-god

// The Messenger Adept - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] [Requires Arrowhead or Counterbalance Stock] "Messenger is one of the most powerful Primaries in the game. It comes loaded with a stellar perk pool and strong stat package, with really two primary playstyles; Desperado or Kill Clip. Typically, you'll want Rapid Hit/Outlaw with Desperado or Heating Up/Rapid Hit with Kill Clip. There's some strong options outside of this, but that's where you'll find the most success - personal preference plays a role here. I usually find more success with Kill Clip, as I prefer maintaining a uniform RPM." tags:pvp-god

// Fatebringer Timelost - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Stability/Reload] "Fatebringer remains as one of the best-in-slot Primaries, for both PvE and PvP. There's a huge amount of customisation available on this, and I'd recommend trying a few out before going straight to Explosive/Firefly.

There's a huge amount of customisation available on this, and I'd recommend trying a few out before going straight to Explosive/Firefly.

// Reed's Regret - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Charge Time/Range] "With Focusing Lens finished, Vorpal nerfed, and Firing Line fixed, Reed's Regret is the clear winner of the Legendary Linear Fusion War. Triple Tap/Firing Line is the usual play, with Clown/Vorpal or Triple/Vorpal being best for solo engagements. Accelerated/Liquid typically don't make too massive a change in overall DPS% unless there's an encounter where you fully expend your ammo, and Enhanced Battery allows easier Triple Tap chaining / larger Clown Cartridge magazines." tags:pve-god

While the PvP-oriented perk selection is fairly small, the ones that it rolls with have transformed the Hand Cannon meta ever since their introduction.

// Escape Velocity - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Stability / Reload] "Arach Jalaal would be proud of this one. 900RPMs aren't for everyone, but if you're a fan, this is one of the best PvE SMGs you can get. Threat Detector or Overflow for Col. 1, Surrounded or Vorpal Vorpal strictly for higher-level activities for Col. 2. Recoil direction is a little skewed, but an otherwise very, very solid choice." tags:pve-god

// The Hothead Adept - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Velocity/Reload] "The Hothead's a completely different beast now that Gjallarhorn's in the mix. Clown Cartridge + Gjally has proven itself to be one of the strongest DPS options in lieu of buffs, and Hothead allows you to bolster this with Field Prep/Ensemble as reliable reload boosters. Outside of Clown, Explosive Light is especially strong, then Vorpal as the backup choice. I think Ensemble could potentially be very strong here, if you're willing to forgo the reserves buff from Field Prep / unable to stay in one uniform position for very long." tags:pve-god

// Praedyth's Revenge Timelost - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling] "Praedyth's is the perfect burst DPS Sniper. With access to Rewind Rounds and High Impact Reserves Frenzy can sometimes be better if you're taking damage, you can practically empty the entire gun in one sitting. On Console, invest in Stability for efficiency's sake, and on PC, aim for Handling. Range plays a part in Aim Assist at, well, range - for actual long-range encounters, you're likely better using something more precise." tags:pve-god

// Uzume RR4 - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Handling] "Uzume has a few PvE options in; Snapshot for general use, Clown Cartridge/Triple Tap for extended damage. Explosive Payload should be your go-to here, with the exception of if you're running Triple Tap / using against Barrier champs, then you should look at Vorpal. Or if you simply don't like Explosive Payload, Vorpal's the play. Invest into a Handling barrel if you're not running Snapshot, and prioritise keeping the magazine high if you're running Triple Tap/Clown Cartridge." tags:pve-god

// Hero of Ages - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Impact] "Unrelenting/Chain Reaction makes this one of the greatest CQC experiences in the game. The now-buffed Unrelenting is the perfect pairing for Swords, especially on a Vortex Frame where you clear multiple enemies at a time to instantly get your health back. One for All is interesting, though not really needed outside of some niche solo Lost Sector situations. Demolitionist is also super interesting, and refunds 50% of your charge attack when using the grenade." tags:pve-god

// Fatebringer - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Stability/Reload] "Fatebringer remains as one of the best-in-slot Primaries, for both PvE and PvP. There's a huge amount of customisation available on this, and I'd recommend trying a few out before going straight to Explosive/Firefly. Personally, Killing Wind/Firefly feels best to me, then Explosive/Frenzy for PvE. Explosive with Opening/Eye of the Storm/Kill Clip are your best PvP options. Any shortcomings you find with the barrel/mag, you're usually able to fix with the Adept mods." tags:pve-god

// The Steady Hand - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Handling] "The Steady Hand is a solid choice for a Kinetic 120RPM, who's main competition stems from True Prophecy. While True Prophecy has the "flinch" edge from either Explosive or Timed Payload, Steady Hand benefits from a couple of notable Handling options, such as Quickdraw/Snapshot. Steady Hand is perfectly paired for bow-blinting builds, and players see great success with Wellspring both pre- and post-ability cooldown changes." tags:pvp-god

// IKELOS_SMG_v1.0.2 - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Reload] "The IKELOS_SMG is probably the best PvE Legendary Primary we've ever had post-Recluse, and I doubt we'll ever get anything better. Threat Detector/Surrounded is just certifiably insane; on an SMG as accurate as this, that makes Warmind Cells, that can be paired with some of the strongest Kinetic weapons in the game... It's nigh-on perfect. I actually recommend Alloy Mag here for the first time ever, simply because its noticeable when Threat Detector's no longer active, and you reach the bottom of the mag fast enough to feel that 33% reduced reload speed from Alloy." tags:pve-god

// Interference VI - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Reload] "Interference VI was the heavy of choice for the World's First Solo Atheon by VoteforShifu - if that's not enough to make it worth using, I don't know what is. Full Court is great in specific circumstances, going up to a 25% explosive damage buff when firing from 50m! away or more, meaning you're ideally firing at a very stationary, very large target. Spike Grenades are a +50% impact damage buff, and with Backup Mag, Clown Cartridge + Demolitionist, there's a real chance of you being able to fire 18 times in a row without reloading or stowing your weapon. Very strong contender should Heavy GLs get some time in the limelight again." tags:pve-god

// Igneous Hammer - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Stability] "Igneous remains a top contender as a powerful 120RPM with a fantastic stat- and perk-package. The main change has been the move away from bringing out 2-tap potential via Rampage, to experimenting more with strafe speeds / better range dueling with Elemental Capacitor / Moving Target / Opening Shot. The right player can still run circles around 140RPMs at the proper engagement distance, and Rapid Hit massively simplifies hitting repeated headshots." tags:pvp-god

// Sacred Provenance - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] [Requires Arrowhead or Counterbalance] "My second-favourite Pulse, after the BR. This is the only remaining 4-burst Pulse Rifle post-sunsetting, with a slim perk pool filled with great perks and a strong stat package. Rapid Hit/Kill Clip is a godly combo. You'll surprise yourself with how quickly you can kill people - typically aim at the neck/high chest, and let the recoil land four headshots." tags:pvp-god

// Royal Entry - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Velocity/Handling] "As of the time of writing, this is the only Rocket in the game to have access to the Holy Trinity; Auto-Loading Holster, Lasting Impression, and intrinsic Tracking. Outside of that, you have an incredible perk pool, boasting Clown Cartridge Gjally's best DPS friend, Impulse Amplifier and Field Prep. It's heartbreakingly poor to farm for, however, as I'm roughly 2000 Strikes in since its introduction, with not really anything to show for it. Perhaps it becomes more accessible post-weapon crafting." tags:pve-god

// Blast Battue - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Velocity] "The main differentiator for Blast Battue is being able to run Clown Cartridge / Chain Reaction. I've kept the perk pool incredibly small on this wish list entry, so if you have this roll, I believe it to be the only one worth keeping over other options. This is a general use ad-clear, soft-DPS option, and its a lot of fun. Run Spike for DPS on LARGE TARGETS +50% Impact damage, and Proximity everywhere else. Heavy Grenade Launchers are inaccurate - Proxim makes up for this." tags:pve-god

// Reed's Regret Adept - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Charge Time/Range] "With Focusing Lens finished, Vorpal nerfed, and Firing Line fixed, Reed's Regret is the clear winner of the Legendary Linear Fusion War. Triple Tap/Firing Line is the usual play, with Clown/Vorpal or Triple/Vorpal being best for solo engagements. Accelerated/Liquid typically don't make too massive a change in overall DPS% unless there's an encounter where you fully expend your ammo, and Enhanced Battery allows easier Triple Tap chaining / larger Clown Cartridge magazines." tags:pve-god

// Darkest Before - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] "Darkest Before is a fantastic option, and very easily the favourite 540RPM. It's only real shortcoming stems from the lack of an "on-demand" damage perk Multi/Kill Clip, though 500 kills in, I feel as though Rampage does the job well - you'll often tackle two enemies at once with a 540RPM, and Rampage helps you get an instant edge on the second without disengaging. Invest in Range, and a little Handling." tags:pvp-god

// Cartesian Coordinate - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Stability / Range] "Cartesian is good. Very good. Even without Particle Deconstruction. In terms of bolt spread and reliability, other Fusions can out-perform it, but Cartesian is a great "ease of use" DPS option due to how accessible it's been to farm for. Just make sure to maximise Stability which directly impacts bolt spread / DPS figures as its fairly inaccurate vs. other Fusions, at least for Console." tags:pve-god

// Igneous Hammer Adept - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Stability] "Igneous remains a top contender as a powerful 120RPM with a fantastic stat- and perk-package. The main change has been the move away from bringing out 2-tap potential via Rampage, to experimenting more with strafe speeds / better range dueling with Elemental Capacitor / Moving Target / Opening Shot. The right player can still run circles around 140RPMs at the proper engagement distance, and Rapid Hit massively simplifies hitting repeated headshots." tags:pvp-god

// Matador 64 - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] "Matador in D2 is basically the Precision Frame Sudden Death. Threat Detector is S-Tier, Pulse Monitor falls closely behind it, and Perpetual Motion is still fairly underrated. Opening Shot is a given at this point, as is Full Choke. I'm sure Swashbuckler can help offset some of the inconsistencies that come with Precision Frame one-shots. It's a solid pick if you get a good roll." tags:pvp-god

// BxR-55 Battler - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling / Stability] [Use Counterbalance Stock if you don't have Arrowhead Brake] "The BR may be the best-feeling gun I've ever experienced in Destiny. It's incredibly consistent, performs way outside of its expected range bracket, encourages playing off-angles and surprise plays, and can effectively counter shotgun-rushers in the mid-to-above-average-skill level. Almost everything works here, but I've put just shy of 1000 Crucible kills into a Perpetual/Elemental Capacitor roll, which allows it to be the tightest bullet spread, with some crazy strafe speeds, and truly gives you the edge in most 1v1 fights. For sixes, if you're a better player, Kill Clip instead of Elemental will make you unstoppable. Is the BR a meta-defining weapon? No. Is it viable? Yes. Is it fun as hell? Oh my god, yes." tags:pvp-god

// True Prophecy - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Stability/Range] "Nothing lives up to the word "Cannon" like True Prophecy. It hits like a truck, fires two different kinds of explosive ammunition, and can absolutely snipe with perks like Rangefinder/Opening Shot on top of the range bonuses from explosive ammo. It's a fantastic deterrent in low-player count Crucible modes, with explosives blocking revives, flinching Sniper lanes, or just putting in chunks of damage for team-shotting. Also fantastic for bow-blinting, but that's a little frowned upon these days." tags:pvp-god

// Dire Promise - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] "Have you a moment to talk about our Lord and Saviour, Dire Promise? There's a reason this gun has a cult following - its been around for years, its got a predictable recoil pattern, feels great, sounds great, and has some stellar perks in Rangefinder/Opening Shot, buffs in Elemental Capacitor, and even some gameplay variety using Swashbuckler that benefits from playing CQC. Big thumbs up for Dire." tags:pvp-god

// Eternity's Edge - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Impact] "I sat here and did 220 Chamber of Starlights using this with Jagged/Relentless/Surrounded and Surrounded Spec. 4000 kills in one sitting. Safe to say this is a top-tier Sword that's unfortunately tied to the Warlock class - Thresh/Surrounded is also a fantastic main-weapon option if combined with Hungry Edge to maximise your ammo. Surrounded Spec is a must here - it allows the perk to linger for 2s and give a pretty fat damage buff too." tags:pve-god

// Blasphemer - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling / Range] "Blasphemer is David fighting Goliath - Goliath being DSC's Heritage. What it lacks in stat packages, it makes up for in unique perks - Threat Detector is an S-Tier pick on Shotguns, with Surplus and Quickdraw also being close contenders. Blasphemer rolls with Opening Shot, and can even utilise Swashbuckler to great effect melee kill = one-shot body for the next 4.5 seconds. Confidence also comes into play, too, and I believe this model of shotgun to be much more familiar to the regular player than the stark contrast that is Heritage." tags:pvp-god

// A Sudden Death - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Handling] "The fastest handling Aggressive Frame in the game. Threat Detector is one of few perks that affect your animation swap speed up to 43% at x2, rather than pure Handling, which is also available on this through Surplus/Elemental Capacitor/Pulse Monitor. Have also included Snapshot Sights, which works wonders combo'd with Full Choke, as we seem to be slowly moving towards a shotgun meta that requires more and more pellet spread investment." tags:pvp-god

// Succession - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling] "The PvE Sniper. With Vorpal, you one-shot Cyclops and "pull" with one shot during Sanctified Mind. With +4 Precise Oracle Disruptors you one-shot Oracles, for the best solo Oracle Atheon strat. It takes two snipes to break a GM Anti-Barrier Shield. So much as aim at a Shrieker and it's done. Succession is always the play. Recombination can be stronger for burst damage too - you're only hampered in a couple of situations by not having Vorpal." tags:pve-god

// Succession - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling/Range] "Succession is criminally slept on as a PvP Sniper. It rolls with perfect combos of Moving Target/No Distractions and Snapshot, one-shot-headshots most if not all Supers without any buff, does 160 to the body that can easily translate into one-shots at the most common resiliences, and just feels really, really good to use. I'm surprised you don't see this in the wild more, given how easily farmed it is." tags:pvp-god

// Seventh Seraph Officer Revolver - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] "What a weapon. Honestly, recommending anything other than Timed Payload feels wrong. It is so, so good on 180RPMs, and you truly feel it as one of the best possible options when Overload Hand Cannons are in the mix. Some decent synergy perks in FTTC/Threat Detector/Firmly Planted that match the 180RPM playstyle. Max out the mag and Reload where you can, and just go to work. P.S: Warmind Cells." tags:pve-god

// Timelines' Vertex - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Stability] "Timeline's Vertex is very stable. Odds are you picked up the roll that Xur sold, and if you did, you're in luck - it's pretty much perfect. Firmly Planted works wonders and activates during/at end of a slide, Snapshot is great for scoping in at the end of a charge to narrow your bolt spread, and then you should have a couple of Zoom options for your scope. It's consistent as all hell, and very, very strong." tags:pvp-god

// Threaded Needle - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Charge Time/Handling] "Threaded Needle is incredibly strong. While Reed's has the edge for team play with Firing Line, Threaded has both Auto-Loading capabilities and access to Frenzy - a perk now often found superior to Vorpal in both damage, and the handling/reload buffs it gives. For solo play, any engagement where you're required to do damage away from 2 teammates, or where Auto-Loading becomes especially important, Threaded will still be the play here." tags:pve-god

// Eye of Sol - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Handling] "The community's favourite 90RPM. Typically you'll want Snapshot on all Snipers that roll with it, though if you really spec into Handling, you could inadvisably forgo it in favour of Opening Shot in Column 4. No Distractions is fantastic for duelling, Moving Target is great for getting extra Aim Assist, and if you're someone who's chaining kills, Killing Wind will help hit successive shots range buff = more AA at a distance." tags:pvp-god

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Handling] "Pellet shotguns are fairly uniform in perk recommendations. Full Choke, Accurized, Slideshot/Quickdraw and Opening Shot. Maybe Assault Mag if you're finding you have to follow-up at range more often than not. If you're full-on aping and sliding then substitute Full Choke for Smallbore or Corkscrew. Copy/paste for the next 50 identical pellet-spread shotties." tags:pvp-god

// Vision of Confluence - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Any] "D2's Vision of Confluence was designed with Anti-Barrier Scout in mind. Rewind Rounds refunds on Barrier Shields, Disruption Break triggers on breaking them, and the gun is just a very strong endgame Primary in general. Due to how these Scouts are balanced, it doesn't see a lot of use outside of endgame, but if that were to change one day, Vision has a stellar perk pool for general use." tags:pve-god

// Found Verdict - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling/Range] "Dubbed by many as the greatest Shotgun in the game. Fantastic stat package, top-tier perks, farmable, and the Adept version can just slot the best mods in the game free of charge. Post-pellet changes, aim for Full Choke and Opening Shot. Frenzy has been said to make a difference in the engagements where you'd normally "ghost hit" someone to leave them one-shot." tags:pvp-god

// Vouchsafe - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] "Unique feel, stellar perk pool, fires little purple explosions. Reissued Vouchsafe is basically a Void Night Watch, and I'm here for it. Since Blind Well became a guaranteed drop per-completion, its a great deal easier to get your hands on one of these - I'd recommend trying out any combination of Rapid Hit/Outlaw/FTTC with Explosive/Dragonfly/Vorpal - Vorpal, of course, is locked behind the Shattered Throne drops only, which massively slims down your chances of getting one." tags:pve-god

// First In, Last Out - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling/Range] "FILO remains one of the best PvE slugs, though somewhat displaced in a hot-swapless sandbox. Invest in high Handling to offset this, and try to maximise mag size without impacting damage output. Auto-Loading Holster will always be the play here, and sometimes Surrounded may outperform Vorpal." tags:pve-god

// Eye of Sol Adept - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Handling] "The community's favourite 90RPM. Typically you'll want Snapshot on all Snipers that roll with it, though if you really spec into Handling, you could inadvisably forgo it in favour of Opening Shot in Column 4. No Distractions is fantastic for duelling, Moving Target is great for getting extra Aim Assist, and if you're someone who's chaining kills, Killing Wind will help hit successive shots range buff = more AA at a distance." tags:pvp-god

// Praedyth's Revenge - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling] "Praedyth's is the perfect burst DPS Sniper. With access to Rewind Rounds and High Impact Reserves Frenzy can sometimes be better if you're taking damage, you can practically empty the entire gun in one sitting. On Console, invest in Stability for efficiency's sake, and on PC, aim for Handling. Range plays a part in Aim Assist at, well, range - for actual long-range encounters, you're likely better using something more precise." tags:pve-god

// The Messenger - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] [Requires Arrowhead or Counterbalance Stock] "Messenger is one of the most powerful Primaries in the game. It comes loaded with a stellar perk pool and strong stat package, with really two primary playstyles; Desperado or Kill Clip. Typically, you'll want Rapid Hit/Outlaw with Desperado or Heating Up/Rapid Hit with Kill Clip. There's some strong options outside of this, but that's where you'll find the most success - personal preference plays a role here. I usually find more success with Kill Clip, as I prefer maintaining a uniform RPM." tags:pvp-god

// Shayura's Wrath - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] "Simply incredible. There's some great Kill Clip-synergy perks in Col. 3, namely Heating Up / Tunnel Vision, some ease-of-use options like Dynamic Sway, Hip-Fire Grip, Moving Target, and then some interesting strafe options running Elemental Capacitor/Moving Target simultaneously. Invest heavily in Range and it'll surprise you how far out you can get kills." tags:pvp-god

// Multimach CCX - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] "The Multimach is a firm favourite of SMG aficionados in high-level PvP. While some farm for explicitly strict rolls, this recommendation has perks for those at different skill levels / platforms included. Typically, you'll want to maximise Range wherever possible, with Stability being crucial on Console, though not really a consideration on PC opening up options like Iron Reach. Kill Clip is great if you are someone able to reliably chain kills, otherwise Iron Grip may suit you during the 900RPM adjustment period huge Stability buff. Threat Detector comes down to personal preference - some players prefer a uniform handling experience, some appreciate the sudden buffs." tags:pvp-god

// Pardon Our Dust - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Velocity] "This is the Grenade Launcher we've always wanted. A Kinetic slot GL that can roll with not only Auto-Loading a first-ever, but Vorpal Weapon simultaneously. If you're a triple GL fan like me, it means you can now run a full suite of Auto-Loading GLs, rotate an ALH Pardon with a Demolitionist Salvo for Atheon damage, or just simply have access to more varied Blinding Grenade builds. Ignition Code is stiff competition in this slot with a similar perk pool - I'd go for Pardon strictly if you're requiring ALH which is its only edge vs. a well-rolled Ignition Code. Also comes with Ambitious Assassin, and Perpetual isn't bad either." tags:pve-god

// Shayura's Wrath Adept - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] "Simply incredible. There's some great Kill Clip-synergy perks in Col. 3, namely Heating Up / Tunnel Vision, some ease-of-use options like Dynamic Sway, Hip-Fire Grip, Moving Target, and then some interesting strafe options running Elemental Capacitor/Moving Target simultaneously. Invest heavily in Range and it'll surprise you how far out you can get kills." tags:pvp-god

// 1000 Yard Stare - [YeezyGT's S16] PvP: god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Handling] "The PvP player's "1K". Rocking the now-incredibly rare combo of Quickdraw/Snapshot, 1K is one of the most fluid-feeling Snipers in the game. The scope decals may require a small adjustment period, but the benefits of being able to invest primarily in Range more aim assist at distance over Handling feel like a great trade-off. This is a familiar-feeling Sniper, a great workhorse, and incredibly easy to farm for. Ticks all the boxes." tags:pvp-god

// Heritage - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling] "Widely regarded as the greatest Legendary slug. There's a lot you can do with Heritage. Moving Target is fantastic on Slugs - +10 Aim Assist is huge. Killing Wind gives you a Diet Chaperone. Hip-Fire Grip is actually really strong here, and I've hit far more hip-fire headshots in the heat of the moment than you'd expect. Keep your Handling as high as possible - the range difference is fairly negligible from 80-100, we're talking about 1 metre of range literally about 1 step in-game, and Handling is massively important." tags:pvp-god

// The Hothead - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Velocity/Reload] "The Hothead's a completely different beast now that Gjallarhorn's in the mix. Clown Cartridge + Gjally has proven itself to be one of the strongest DPS options in lieu of buffs, and Hothead allows you to bolster this with Field Prep/Ensemble as reliable reload boosters. Outside of Clown, Explosive Light is especially strong, then Vorpal as the backup choice. I think Ensemble could potentially be very strong here, if you're willing to forgo the reserves buff from Field Prep / unable to stay in one uniform position for very long." tags:pve-god

// Hung Jury SR4 - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Any] "Hung Jury is a fantastic option for high-end content, rivalled in-slot primarily by Night Watch. It really comes down to personal preference - in general, Explosive Rounds on a Scout Rifle is fantastic, Rapid Hit is fantastic, Subsistence is fantastic... Hung Jury's a great workhorse and it can't really steer you wrong. Even on the Adept, I appreciate having a few more bullets in the mag with Backup Mag as I've always been an Overflow Night Watch guy." tags:pve-god

// Under Your Skin - [YeezyGT's WQ] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Draw Time] "Under Your Skin is incredible. Now usurping Imperial Needle with the classic Archer's/Explosive Head combo, optional Crafting to fully invest into Draw Time, fantastic alternatives in Hip-Fire Grip, reload boosters in Perpetual Motion, ad clear in Dragonfly, and the true Hawkeye combo of Archer's/Successful Warm Up to mimic the Hush days of old. Fantastic bow. Shades well too." tags:pve-god

// Cantata-57 - [YeezyGT's WQ] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Range / Stab] "Cantata's taken the new season by storm. With access to S-Tier perks like Eye of the Storm / Opening Shot, Rapid Hit / Rangefinder, Vorpal swappables, Timed Payload for flinch, Moving Target for Aim Assist - there's something here for everyone. Invest into Range where possible when not using Rangefinder, and try to find the stability kick that works for you. Feels somewhat similar to Waking Vigil, which is a bit of an acquired taste." tags:pvp-god

// Forbearance - [YeezyGT's WQ] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Reload] "Forby is the best Legendary weapon of the expansion. A wave frame version of Salvo, which means you'll get way more shots off no waiting for travel time, can point it at your feet, Souldrinker that heals you, Chain Reaction that essentially matches the Dead Messenger blast radius, its a Craftable, combo with Explosive Wellmaker and Well of Life to become unkillable as you run through trash adds like Thor, God of Thunder. It's viable in every level of content. It's Forby. It's King." tags:pve-god

// Deliverance - [YeezyGT's WQ] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Charge] "Deliverance is a one-of-a-kind with an incredible suite of perks. It's difficult to recommend something specific, as there's a great deal of synergistic perk options here. Compulsive/Chill Clip is a Reservoir Burst-esque combo, without detrimentally increasing mag size. Cornered/Surrounded is a godly combo that cuts down Charge Time and massively increases damage output Enhanced Surrounded + Spec is an ENORMOUS +47% buff, Demolitionist/Adrenaline Junkie have natural synergy, along with Demo/Chill Clip, Heating Up/Tap the Trigger, Perpetual Motion for consistency... Almost anything works here. Invest in getting that Charge Time down as far as you can while maintaining Range and bolt spread Stability." tags:pve-god

// Silicon Neuroma Adept - [YeezyGT's WQ] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Handling / Range] "Silicon Neuroma's back, and coming for Succession's neck. Snapshot/Opening Shot is the usual god-roll, though there's some interesting interactions with Frenzy / Adrenaline Junkie in a separate col. to Snapshot that allows for 1-shot body shots setup-dependent. Firmly Planted also has a strong following, so its safe to say we'll see some of these floating around when the Adepts become available." tags:pvp-god

// Piece of Mind - [YeezyGT's WQ] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Stab / Handling] "Piece of Mind is likely the best 540RPM we've had so far. Craftable, with some stellar perks, you're sure to be able to find something here you'll love. Consistency is king here, and its important to note the fine-tuning will feel different on console vs. PC invest into more Recoil Direction on Console, whereas PC can offset this somewhat by investing further into Stability. Castle Content / Ivan F Karamazov have a great breakdown on how to fine-tune this for the best results. Definitely give it a watch if you're looking to spend some mats on this gun." tags:pvp-god

// Fortissimo-11 - [YeezyGT's WQ] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Range] "Fortissimo's pretty crazy - if you wanted to, you could take this thing to 96 Range, 100 Handling. There's a masterclass of perks here, with access to Perpetual/Surplus/Threat Detector/Pulse Monitor/Steady Hands, then E-Cap/Moving Target/Opening Shot/Frenzy/Vorpal. This is a slug frame I much prefer feel-wise to Heritage, closer to the more traditional gun styles from earlier in the franchise's lifespan. I'm sure most people will come across at least one roll that will work for them - it's a great gun." tags:pvp-god

// Funnelweb - [YeezyGT's WQ] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Reload / Range] "Funnelweb is everything we've ever wanted. Great stats, great recoil direction, the classic "Recluse"-style Veist frame, with the new Veist Origin Trait that randomly refills the mag mid-stream, Subsistence that refunds the mag on kills, and damage perks that can maintain near-constant uptime Frenzy / Adrenaline. It comes at a perfect time, combining Void typing with Void 3.0's Volatile Rounds. There will be a good amount of people who pick this thing up, and then never put it back down. Thank you Bungie." tags:pve-god

// Silicon Neuroma - [YeezyGT's WQ] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Handling / Range] "Silicon Neuroma's back, and coming for Succession's neck. Snapshot/Opening Shot is the usual god-roll, though there's some interesting interactions with Frenzy / Adrenaline Junkie in a separate col. to Snapshot that allows for 1-shot body shots setup-dependent. Firmly Planted also has a strong following, so its safe to say we'll see some of these floating around when the Adepts become available." tags:pvp-god

// Palmyra-B - [YeezyGT's WQ] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Handling] "Palmyra-B is Izanagi's best friend. Auto-Loading Holster with Explosive Light is going to be your go-to for all your damage needs, unless for some reason you want to shoot all rockets consecutively, then you're after Impulse/Frenzy or Impulse/Explosive Light depending on orb usage but likely another rocket altogether that actually rolls with Clown Cartridge. Regardless, Palmyra is a great Rocket - invest into Handling rather than Velocity to get more reliable tracking." tags:pve-god

// Typhon GL5 - [YeezyGT's WQ] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Velocity / Reload] "Typhon GL5 feels fantastic - Impulse Amplifier, as always, seems to be the driving force for this, along with the new Omolon Origin Trait that bolsters reload for the top half of the magazine. Explosive Light is a top-tier option for orb-heavy engagements, though comes into effect less often than you'd think post-orb change. Adrenaline Junkie would be my workhorse recommendation here, until the day that Heavy Grenade Launchers see themselves as a viable DPS option again." tags:pve-god

// Submission - [YeezyGT's WQ] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Reload / Range] "Submission is great. As a Craftable, Enhanced Subsistence refunds up to +25% of the mag per kill, Enhanced Overflow gives an additional bonus from +5-20%, and then Frenzy elevates pretty much any SMG into god-tier status. Souldrinker is a perfect Origin Trait for the gun. The whole package is just able to synergise really well together." tags:pve-god

// Thoughtless - [YeezyGT's WQ] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Handling] "Thoughtless is the secret DPS Sniper that we probably won't see properly utilised again until the next Raid race. With Enhanced Overflow, Extended Mag and Backup Mag, it maxes out at 17! in the mag, when paired with Font of Might, goes toe-to-toe with Izanagi's Burden. It's a bit more difficult to optimise swaps, but frees up the Exotic slot. Firing Line is the obvious option, though Focused Fury has a pretty low activation requirement, and allows you to use it solo / separate from teammates. That should come down to personal preference." tags:pve-god

// Ragnhild-D - [YeezyGT's WQ] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's WQ] [MW: Range] "Ragnhild has some fantastic Handling-based options, with access to E-Cap, Frenzy, Steady Hands and Perpetual Motion - the rule of thumb here is to get as close to 60 Range as you can Ragnhild maxes out at 60 for consistency's sake. That unfortunately results in the loss of Full Choke / Assault Mag options, if you want to get the full bang-for-your-buck in the OHK department. Ivan F Karamazov has a great breakdown on what works for this and why - definitely worth checking out before dumping your mats." tags:pvp-god

// Avalanche - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Stability] "Avalanche rolls with the tried-and-true combo of Extended Mag/Auto-Loading/Damage perk. Opt for Swashbuckler/Adrenaline for most content, Vorpal for higher-end, and Dragonfly if you've got a very high Stability roll that feels stable enough to reliably hit headshots. Avalanche kicks quite a bit on Console, but the damage it puts out once it gets going is fairly devastating to waves of enemies." tags:pve-god

// Eyasluna - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] "Eyasluna is utterly fantastic. There are so many viable rolls on this that your best bet is to just go out and try them - what works for you may be completely different to everyone else. If you want some guidance; Col. 2: [Ricochet for stats, High-Cal/Armor Piercing for flinch], Col. 3: [Rangefinder for Zoom, Perpetual for constant buffs, Rapid Hit for ensuring you win the fights you start], Col 4: [Headstone for Stasis, Kill Clip for slaying in sixes, Moving Target for Aim Assist]. This is probably the easiest gun farm we've ever had, and for a great variable Hand Cannon that you can build to your preference. Give it a go." tags:pvp-god

// The Palindrome - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] "Palindrome's a household name. While the PvP-oriented perk selection is fairly small, the ones that it rolls with have transformed the Hand Cannon meta ever since their introduction. Typically you'll run Quickdraw/Killing Wind with Rangefinder/Rampage depending on your playstyle. I've seen a number of people using Thresh to great effect in sixes, also." tags:pvp-god

// Falling Guillotine - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Impact] "The even-edgier Dark Drinker. Post-Whirlwind nerfs, there's a real case for having a Surrounded version of this tucked away - with Surrounded Spec, it goes up to +35% instantly, with a 2s lingering buff after no longer being near enemies. It's enough to just about one-shot stunned Unstoppable Phalanxes in Legend-level content, using Jagged Edge. Whirlwind is still very strong for sustained DPS phases, just not as good as it once was -- Guillotine doesn't have an option to slot Vorpal, so its essentially down to "Will there be enemies in this encounter, or just the boss to focus on?"" tags:pve-god

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling/Range] "Dubbed by many as the greatest Shotgun in the game. Fantastic stat package, top-tier perks, farmable, and the Adept version can just slot the best mods in the game free of charge. Post-pellet changes, aim for Full Choke and Opening Shot. Frenzy has been said to make a difference in the engagements where you'd normally "ghost hit" someone to leave them one-shot." tags:pvp-god

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Any] "Hung Jury is a fantastic option for high-end content, rivalled in-slot primarily by Night Watch. It really comes down to personal preference - in general, Explosive Rounds on a Scout Rifle is fantastic, Rapid Hit is fantastic, Subsistence is fantastic... Hung Jury's a great workhorse and it can't really steer you wrong. Even on the Adept, I appreciate having a few more bullets in the mag with Backup Mag as I've always been an Overflow Night Watch guy." tags:pve-god

// Vision of Confluence Timelost - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Any] "D2's Vision of Confluence was designed with Anti-Barrier Scout in mind. Rewind Rounds refunds on Barrier Shields, Disruption Break triggers on breaking them, and the gun is just a very strong endgame Primary in general. Due to how these Scouts are balanced, it doesn't see a lot of use outside of endgame, but if that were to change one day, Vision has a stellar perk pool for general use." tags:pve-god

// Uzume RR4 Adept - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Handling] "Uzume has a few PvE options in; Snapshot for general use, Clown Cartridge/Triple Tap for extended damage. Explosive Payload should be your go-to here, with the exception of if you're running Triple Tap / using against Barrier champs, then you should look at Vorpal. Or if you simply don't like Explosive Payload, Vorpal's the play. Invest into a Handling barrel if you're not running Snapshot, and prioritise keeping the magazine high if you're running Triple Tap/Clown Cartridge." tags:pve-god

// Occluded Finality - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling/Range] "We've been so used to 45 Zoom in D2 for so long, that Occluded Finality's 58 feels like you've accidentally equipped a telescope. It's a completely different set of disciplines you need to practice when using Occluded - you need to be certain that the lane you're peeking is where the action will be, as if you're wrong, you're likely blindsided when ADS'd. That's the trade off for the extra-generous Zoom allowing you to pick out every pixel of your enemy's helmet. Stick with Snapshot, Opening Shot is strong as always, Eye of the Storm is great when being flinched out of your binoculars." tags:pvp-god

// One Small Step - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling] "Primarily used as one of the perfect-roll One-Two Punch Shotguns. Invest highly into Handling, then Auto-Loading Holster / One-Two Punch are your go-to here. Full Choke strongly, strongly recommended for the above. Outside of OTP builds, you can do some interesting stuff with Trench Barrel to try and mimic the efficacy of the IKELOS_SG, but in the Kinetic slot." tags:pve-god

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Reload] What a weapon. Pellet shotties got a 10% PvE buff at the tail-end of Season 15, and it does feel noticeable in practice, especially when spraying down yellow bars or Fallen Walkers with shot-after-shot-after-shot from a Rapid-Fire Frame. Threat Detector is an S-Tier choice. Surrounded is made for this weapon. Vorpal is a great backup. Trench Barrel comes in at +50% - if you can remember to melee-stompcancel, you will chew through that enemy. Also: Warmind Cells. Run Fireteam Medic and you become unstoppable." tags:pve-god

// The Messenger Adept - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] [Requires Arrowhead or Counterbalance Stock] "Messenger is one of the most powerful Primaries in the game. It comes loaded with a stellar perk pool and strong stat package, with really two primary playstyles; Desperado or Kill Clip. Typically, you'll want Rapid Hit/Outlaw with Desperado or Heating Up/Rapid Hit with Kill Clip. There's some strong options outside of this, but that's where you'll find the most success - personal preference plays a role here. I usually find more success with Kill Clip, as I prefer maintaining a uniform RPM." tags:pvp-god

// Fatebringer Timelost - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Stability/Reload] "Fatebringer remains as one of the best-in-slot Primaries, for both PvE and PvP. There's a huge amount of customisation available on this, and I'd recommend trying a few out before going straight to Explosive/Firefly. Personally, Killing Wind/Firefly feels best to me, then Explosive/Frenzy for PvE. Explosive with Opening/Eye of the Storm/Kill Clip are your best PvP options. Any shortcomings you find with the barrel/mag, you're usually able to fix with the Adept mods." tags:pve-god

// Reed's Regret - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Charge Time/Range] "With Focusing Lens finished, Vorpal nerfed, and Firing Line fixed, Reed's Regret is the clear winner of the Legendary Linear Fusion War. Triple Tap/Firing Line is the usual play, with Clown/Vorpal or Triple/Vorpal being best for solo engagements. Accelerated/Liquid typically don't make too massive a change in overall DPS% unless there's an encounter where you fully expend your ammo, and Enhanced Battery allows easier Triple Tap chaining / larger Clown Cartridge magazines." tags:pve-god

// The Palindrome Adept - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] "Palindrome's a household name. While the PvP-oriented perk selection is fairly small, the ones that it rolls with have transformed the Hand Cannon meta ever since their introduction. Typically you'll run Quickdraw/Killing Wind with Rangefinder/Rampage depending on your playstyle. I've seen a number of people using Thresh to great effect in sixes, also." tags:pvp-god

// Escape Velocity - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Stability / Reload] "Arach Jalaal would be proud of this one. 900RPMs aren't for everyone, but if you're a fan, this is one of the best PvE SMGs you can get. Threat Detector or Overflow for Col. 1, Surrounded or Vorpal Vorpal strictly for higher-level activities for Col. 2. Recoil direction is a little skewed, but an otherwise very, very solid choice." tags:pve-god

// The Hothead Adept - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Velocity/Reload] "The Hothead's a completely different beast now that Gjallarhorn's in the mix. Clown Cartridge + Gjally has proven itself to be one of the strongest DPS options in lieu of buffs, and Hothead allows you to bolster this with Field Prep/Ensemble as reliable reload boosters. Outside of Clown, Explosive Light is especially strong, then Vorpal as the backup choice. I think Ensemble could potentially be very strong here, if you're willing to forgo the reserves buff from Field Prep / unable to stay in one uniform position for very long." tags:pve-god

With access to Rewind Rounds and High Impact Reserves Frenzy can sometimes be better if you're taking damage, you can practically empty the entire gun in one sitting. On Console, invest in Stability for efficiency's sake, and on PC, aim for Handling. Range plays a part in Aim Assist at, well, range - for actual long-range encounters, you're likely better using something more precise." tags:pve-god

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Handling] "Uzume has a few PvE options in; Snapshot for general use, Clown Cartridge/Triple Tap for extended damage. Explosive Payload should be your go-to here, with the exception of if you're running Triple Tap / using against Barrier champs, then you should look at Vorpal. Or if you simply don't like Explosive Payload, Vorpal's the play. Invest into a Handling barrel if you're not running Snapshot, and prioritise keeping the magazine high if you're running Triple Tap/Clown Cartridge." tags:pve-god

// Hero of Ages - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Impact] "Unrelenting/Chain Reaction makes this one of the greatest CQC experiences in the game. The now-buffed Unrelenting is the perfect pairing for Swords, especially on a Vortex Frame where you clear multiple enemies at a time to instantly get your health back. One for All is interesting, though not really needed outside of some niche solo Lost Sector situations. Demolitionist is also super interesting, and refunds 50% of your charge attack when using the grenade." tags:pve-god

// Fatebringer - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Stability/Reload] "Fatebringer remains as one of the best-in-slot Primaries, for both PvE and PvP. There's a huge amount of customisation available on this, and I'd recommend trying a few out before going straight to Explosive/Firefly. Personally, Killing Wind/Firefly feels best to me, then Explosive/Frenzy for PvE. Explosive with Opening/Eye of the Storm/Kill Clip are your best PvP options. Any shortcomings you find with the barrel/mag, you're usually able to fix with the Adept mods." tags:pve-god

There's a huge amount of customisation available on this, and I'd recommend trying a few out before going straight to Explosive/Firefly. Personally, Killing Wind/Firefly feels best to me, then Explosive/Frenzy for PvE. Explosive with Opening/Eye of the Storm/Kill Clip are your best PvP options. Any shortcomings you find with the barrel/mag, you're usually able to fix with the Adept mods." tags:pvp-god

// The Steady Hand - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Handling] "The Steady Hand is a solid choice for a Kinetic 120RPM, who's main competition stems from True Prophecy. While True Prophecy has the "flinch" edge from either Explosive or Timed Payload, Steady Hand benefits from a couple of notable Handling options, such as Quickdraw/Snapshot. Steady Hand is perfectly paired for bow-blinting builds, and players see great success with Wellspring both pre- and post-ability cooldown changes." tags:pvp-god

// IKELOS_SMG_v1.0.2 - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Reload] "The IKELOS_SMG is probably the best PvE Legendary Primary we've ever had post-Recluse, and I doubt we'll ever get anything better. Threat Detector/Surrounded is just certifiably insane; on an SMG as accurate as this, that makes Warmind Cells, that can be paired with some of the strongest Kinetic weapons in the game... It's nigh-on perfect. I actually recommend Alloy Mag here for the first time ever, simply because its noticeable when Threat Detector's no longer active, and you reach the bottom of the mag fast enough to feel that 33% reduced reload speed from Alloy." tags:pve-god

// Interference VI - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Reload] "Interference VI was the heavy of choice for the World's First Solo Atheon by VoteforShifu - if that's not enough to make it worth using, I don't know what is. Full Court is great in specific circumstances, going up to a 25% explosive damage buff when firing from 50m! away or more, meaning you're ideally firing at a very stationary, very large target. Spike Grenades are a +50% impact damage buff, and with Backup Mag, Clown Cartridge + Demolitionist, there's a real chance of you being able to fire 18 times in a row without reloading or stowing your weapon. Very strong contender should Heavy GLs get some time in the limelight again." tags:pve-god

// Igneous Hammer - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Stability] "Igneous remains a top contender as a powerful 120RPM with a fantastic stat- and perk-package. The main change has been the move away from bringing out 2-tap potential via Rampage, to experimenting more with strafe speeds / better range dueling with Elemental Capacitor / Moving Target / Opening Shot. The right player can still run circles around 140RPMs at the proper engagement distance, and Rapid Hit massively simplifies hitting repeated headshots." tags:pvp-god

// Sacred Provenance - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] [Requires Arrowhead or Counterbalance] "My second-favourite Pulse, after the BR. This is the only remaining 4-burst Pulse Rifle post-sunsetting, with a slim perk pool filled with great perks and a strong stat package. Rapid Hit/Kill Clip is a godly combo. You'll surprise yourself with how quickly you can kill people - typically aim at the neck/high chest, and let the recoil land four headshots." tags:pvp-god

// Royal Entry - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Velocity/Handling] "As of the time of writing, this is the only Rocket in the game to have access to the Holy Trinity; Auto-Loading Holster, Lasting Impression, and intrinsic Tracking. Outside of that, you have an incredible perk pool, boasting Clown Cartridge Gjally's best DPS friend, Impulse Amplifier and Field Prep. It's heartbreakingly poor to farm for, however, as I'm roughly 2000 Strikes in since its introduction, with not really anything to show for it. Perhaps it becomes more accessible post-weapon crafting." tags:pve-god

// Blast Battue - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Velocity] "The main differentiator for Blast Battue is being able to run Clown Cartridge / Chain Reaction. I've kept the perk pool incredibly small on this wish list entry, so if you have this roll, I believe it to be the only one worth keeping over other options. This is a general use ad-clear, soft-DPS option, and its a lot of fun. Run Spike for DPS on LARGE TARGETS +50% Impact damage, and Proximity everywhere else. Heavy Grenade Launchers are inaccurate - Proxim makes up for this." tags:pve-god

// Reed's Regret Adept - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Charge Time/Range] "With Focusing Lens finished, Vorpal nerfed, and Firing Line fixed, Reed's Regret is the clear winner of the Legendary Linear Fusion War. Triple Tap/Firing Line is the usual play, with Clown/Vorpal or Triple/Vorpal being best for solo engagements. Accelerated/Liquid typically don't make too massive a change in overall DPS% unless there's an encounter where you fully expend your ammo, and Enhanced Battery allows easier Triple Tap chaining / larger Clown Cartridge magazines." tags:pve-god

// Darkest Before - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] "Darkest Before is a fantastic option, and very easily the favourite 540RPM. It's only real shortcoming stems from the lack of an "on-demand" damage perk Multi/Kill Clip, though 500 kills in, I feel as though Rampage does the job well - you'll often tackle two enemies at once with a 540RPM, and Rampage helps you get an instant edge on the second without disengaging. Invest in Range, and a little Handling." tags:pvp-god

// Cartesian Coordinate - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Stability / Range] "Cartesian is good. Very good. Even without Particle Deconstruction. In terms of bolt spread and reliability, other Fusions can out-perform it, but Cartesian is a great "ease of use" DPS option due to how accessible it's been to farm for. Just make sure to maximise Stability which directly impacts bolt spread / DPS figures as its fairly inaccurate vs. other Fusions, at least for Console." tags:pve-god

High Handling, Lasting Impression and Auto-Loading Holster are the key components here - there's some other contending options here, but not much that isn't done better than other Rocket options." tags:pve-god

// Igneous Hammer Adept - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Stability] "Igneous remains a top contender as a powerful 120RPM with a fantastic stat- and perk-package. The main change has been the move away from bringing out 2-tap potential via Rampage, to experimenting more with strafe speeds / better range dueling with Elemental Capacitor / Moving Target / Opening Shot. The right player can still run circles around 140RPMs at the proper engagement distance, and Rapid Hit massively simplifies hitting repeated headshots." tags:pvp-god

// Matador 64 - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] "Matador in D2 is basically the Precision Frame Sudden Death. Threat Detector is S-Tier, Pulse Monitor falls closely behind it, and Perpetual Motion is still fairly underrated. Opening Shot is a given at this point, as is Full Choke. I'm sure Swashbuckler can help offset some of the inconsistencies that come with Precision Frame one-shots. It's a solid pick if you get a good roll." tags:pvp-god

// BxR-55 Battler - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling / Stability] [Use Counterbalance Stock if you don't have Arrowhead Brake] "The BR may be the best-feeling gun I've ever experienced in Destiny. It's incredibly consistent, performs way outside of its expected range bracket, encourages playing off-angles and surprise plays, and can effectively counter shotgun-rushers in the mid-to-above-average-skill level. Almost everything works here, but I've put just shy of 1000 Crucible kills into a Perpetual/Elemental Capacitor roll, which allows it to be the tightest bullet spread, with some crazy strafe speeds, and truly gives you the edge in most 1v1 fights. For sixes, if you're a better player, Kill Clip instead of Elemental will make you unstoppable. Is the BR a meta-defining weapon? No. Is it viable? Yes. Is it fun as hell? Oh my god, yes." tags:pvp-god

// True Prophecy - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Stability/Range] "Nothing lives up to the word "Cannon" like True Prophecy. It hits like a truck, fires two different kinds of explosive ammunition, and can absolutely snipe with perks like Rangefinder/Opening Shot on top of the range bonuses from explosive ammo. It's a fantastic deterrent in low-player count Crucible modes, with explosives blocking revives, flinching Sniper lanes, or just putting in chunks of damage for team-shotting. Also fantastic for bow-blinting, but that's a little frowned upon these days." tags:pvp-god

// Dire Promise - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] "Have you a moment to talk about our Lord and Saviour, Dire Promise? There's a reason this gun has a cult following - its been around for years, its got a predictable recoil pattern, feels great, sounds great, and has some stellar perks in Rangefinder/Opening Shot, buffs in Elemental Capacitor, and even some gameplay variety using Swashbuckler that benefits from playing CQC. Big thumbs up for Dire." tags:pvp-god

// Eternity's Edge - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Impact] "I sat here and did 220 Chamber of Starlights using this with Jagged/Relentless/Surrounded and Surrounded Spec. 4000 kills in one sitting. Safe to say this is a top-tier Sword that's unfortunately tied to the Warlock class - Thresh/Surrounded is also a fantastic main-weapon option if combined with Hungry Edge to maximise your ammo. Surrounded Spec is a must here - it allows the perk to linger for 2s and give a pretty fat damage buff too." tags:pve-god

// Blasphemer - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling / Range] "Blasphemer is David fighting Goliath - Goliath being DSC's Heritage. What it lacks in stat packages, it makes up for in unique perks - Threat Detector is an S-Tier pick on Shotguns, with Surplus and Quickdraw also being close contenders. Blasphemer rolls with Opening Shot, and can even utilise Swashbuckler to great effect melee kill = one-shot body for the next 4.5 seconds. Confidence also comes into play, too, and I believe this model of shotgun to be much more familiar to the regular player than the stark contrast that is Heritage." tags:pvp-god

// A Sudden Death - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Handling] "The fastest handling Aggressive Frame in the game. Threat Detector is one of few perks that affect your animation swap speed up to 43% at x2, rather than pure Handling, which is also available on this through Surplus/Elemental Capacitor/Pulse Monitor. Have also included Snapshot Sights, which works wonders combo'd with Full Choke, as we seem to be slowly moving towards a shotgun meta that requires more and more pellet spread investment." tags:pvp-god

// Succession - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling] "The PvE Sniper. With Vorpal, you one-shot Cyclops and "pull" with one shot during Sanctified Mind. With +4 Precise Oracle Disruptors you one-shot Oracles, for the best solo Oracle Atheon strat. It takes two snipes to break a GM Anti-Barrier Shield. So much as aim at a Shrieker and it's done. Succession is always the play. Recombination can be stronger for burst damage too - you're only hampered in a couple of situations by not having Vorpal." tags:pve-god

// Succession - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling/Range] "Succession is criminally slept on as a PvP Sniper. It rolls with perfect combos of Moving Target/No Distractions and Snapshot, one-shot-headshots most if not all Supers without any buff, does 160 to the body that can easily translate into one-shots at the most common resiliences, and just feels really, really good to use. I'm surprised you don't see this in the wild more, given how easily farmed it is." tags:pvp-god

// Seventh Seraph Officer Revolver - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] "What a weapon. Honestly, recommending anything other than Timed Payload feels wrong. It is so, so good on 180RPMs, and you truly feel it as one of the best possible options when Overload Hand Cannons are in the mix. Some decent synergy perks in FTTC/Threat Detector/Firmly Planted that match the 180RPM playstyle. Max out the mag and Reload where you can, and just go to work. P.S: Warmind Cells." tags:pve-god

// Timelines' Vertex - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Stability] "Timeline's Vertex is very stable. Odds are you picked up the roll that Xur sold, and if you did, you're in luck - it's pretty much perfect. Firmly Planted works wonders and activates during/at end of a slide, Snapshot is great for scoping in at the end of a charge to narrow your bolt spread, and then you should have a couple of Zoom options for your scope. It's consistent as all hell, and very, very strong." tags:pvp-god

// Threaded Needle - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Charge Time/Handling] "Threaded Needle is incredibly strong. While Reed's has the edge for team play with Firing Line, Threaded has both Auto-Loading capabilities and access to Frenzy - a perk now often found superior to Vorpal in both damage, and the handling/reload buffs it gives. For solo play, any engagement where you're required to do damage away from 2 teammates, or where Auto-Loading becomes especially important, Threaded will still be the play here." tags:pve-god

// Eye of Sol - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Handling] "The community's favourite 90RPM. Typically you'll want Snapshot on all Snipers that roll with it, though if you really spec into Handling, you could inadvisably forgo it in favour of Opening Shot in Column 4. No Distractions is fantastic for duelling, Moving Target is great for getting extra Aim Assist, and if you're someone who's chaining kills, Killing Wind will help hit successive shots range buff = more AA at a distance." tags:pvp-god

// Fractethyst - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Handling] "Pellet shotguns are fairly uniform in perk recommendations. Full Choke, Accurized, Slideshot/Quickdraw and Opening Shot. Maybe Assault Mag if you're finding you have to follow-up at range more often than not. If you're full-on aping and sliding then substitute Full Choke for Smallbore or Corkscrew. Copy/paste for the next 50 identical pellet-spread shotties." tags:pvp-god

// Vision of Confluence - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Any] "D2's Vision of Confluence was designed with Anti-Barrier Scout in mind. Rewind Rounds refunds on Barrier Shields, Disruption Break triggers on breaking them, and the gun is just a very strong endgame Primary in general. Due to how these Scouts are balanced, it doesn't see a lot of use outside of endgame, but if that were to change one day, Vision has a stellar perk pool for general use." tags:pve-god

// Found Verdict - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling/Range] "Dubbed by many as the greatest Shotgun in the game. Fantastic stat package, top-tier perks, farmable, and the Adept version can just slot the best mods in the game free of charge. Post-pellet changes, aim for Full Choke and Opening Shot. Frenzy has been said to make a difference in the engagements where you'd normally "ghost hit" someone to leave them one-shot." tags:pvp-god

// Vouchsafe - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] "Unique feel, stellar perk pool, fires little purple explosions. Reissued Vouchsafe is basically a Void Night Watch, and I'm here for it. Since Blind Well became a guaranteed drop per-completion, its a great deal easier to get your hands on one of these - I'd recommend trying out any combination of Rapid Hit/Outlaw/FTTC with Explosive/Dragonfly/Vorpal - Vorpal, of course, is locked behind the Shattered Throne drops only, which massively slims down your chances of getting one." tags:pve-god

I'm not recommending any perk other than Eager Edge, because without it, Bequest is just straight up better in every way. Don't let anyone call you a Blue Sword Noob - you're a man of refined taste, an individual, a man who respects the ammo economy with Relentless Strikes, or is constantly fueling Super with Thresh. This is clearly a conscious choice." tags:pve-god

// First In, Last Out - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling/Range] "FILO remains one of the best PvE slugs, though somewhat displaced in a hot-swapless sandbox. Invest in high Handling to offset this, and try to maximise mag size without impacting damage output. Auto-Loading Holster will always be the play here, and sometimes Surrounded may outperform Vorpal." tags:pve-god

// Eye of Sol Adept - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Handling] "The community's favourite 90RPM. Typically you'll want Snapshot on all Snipers that roll with it, though if you really spec into Handling, you could inadvisably forgo it in favour of Opening Shot in Column 4. No Distractions is fantastic for duelling, Moving Target is great for getting extra Aim Assist, and if you're someone who's chaining kills, Killing Wind will help hit successive shots range buff = more AA at a distance." tags:pvp-god

// Praedyth's Revenge - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling] "Praedyth's is the perfect burst DPS Sniper. With access to Rewind Rounds and High Impact Reserves Frenzy can sometimes be better if you're taking damage, you can practically empty the entire gun in one sitting. On Console, invest in Stability for efficiency's sake, and on PC, aim for Handling. Range plays a part in Aim Assist at, well, range - for actual long-range encounters, you're likely better using something more precise." tags:pve-god

// The Messenger - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] [Requires Arrowhead or Counterbalance Stock] "Messenger is one of the most powerful Primaries in the game. It comes loaded with a stellar perk pool and strong stat package, with really two primary playstyles; Desperado or Kill Clip. Typically, you'll want Rapid Hit/Outlaw with Desperado or Heating Up/Rapid Hit with Kill Clip. There's some strong options outside of this, but that's where you'll find the most success - personal preference plays a role here. I usually find more success with Kill Clip, as I prefer maintaining a uniform RPM." tags:pvp-god

// Shayura's Wrath - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] "Simply incredible. There's some great Kill Clip-synergy perks in Col. 3, namely Heating Up / Tunnel Vision, some ease-of-use options like Dynamic Sway, Hip-Fire Grip, Moving Target, and then some interesting strafe options running Elemental Capacitor/Moving Target simultaneously. Invest heavily in Range and it'll surprise you how far out you can get kills." tags:pvp-god

// Multimach CCX - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] "The Multimach is a firm favourite of SMG aficionados in high-level PvP. While some farm for explicitly strict rolls, this recommendation has perks for those at different skill levels / platforms included. Typically, you'll want to maximise Range wherever possible, with Stability being crucial on Console, though not really a consideration on PC opening up options like Iron Reach. Kill Clip is great if you are someone able to reliably chain kills, otherwise Iron Grip may suit you during the 900RPM adjustment period huge Stability buff. Threat Detector comes down to personal preference - some players prefer a uniform handling experience, some appreciate the sudden buffs." tags:pvp-god

// Pardon Our Dust - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Velocity] "This is the Grenade Launcher we've always wanted. A Kinetic slot GL that can roll with not only Auto-Loading a first-ever, but Vorpal Weapon simultaneously. If you're a triple GL fan like me, it means you can now run a full suite of Auto-Loading GLs, rotate an ALH Pardon with a Demolitionist Salvo for Atheon damage, or just simply have access to more varied Blinding Grenade builds. Ignition Code is stiff competition in this slot with a similar perk pool - I'd go for Pardon strictly if you're requiring ALH which is its only edge vs. a well-rolled Ignition Code. Also comes with Ambitious Assassin, and Perpetual isn't bad either." tags:pve-god

// Shayura's Wrath Adept - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range] "Simply incredible. There's some great Kill Clip-synergy perks in Col. 3, namely Heating Up / Tunnel Vision, some ease-of-use options like Dynamic Sway, Hip-Fire Grip, Moving Target, and then some interesting strafe options running Elemental Capacitor/Moving Target simultaneously. Invest heavily in Range and it'll surprise you how far out you can get kills." tags:pvp-god

// 1000 Yard Stare - [YeezyGT's S16] PvP: god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Range/Handling] "The PvP player's "1K". Rocking the now-incredibly rare combo of Quickdraw/Snapshot, 1K is one of the most fluid-feeling Snipers in the game. The scope decals may require a small adjustment period, but the benefits of being able to invest primarily in Range more aim assist at distance over Handling feel like a great trade-off. This is a familiar-feeling Sniper, a great workhorse, and incredibly easy to farm for. Ticks all the boxes." tags:pvp-god

//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Handling] "Widely regarded as the greatest Legendary slug. There's a lot you can do with Heritage. Moving Target is fantastic on Slugs - +10 Aim Assist is huge. Killing Wind gives you a Diet Chaperone. Hip-Fire Grip is actually really strong here, and I've hit far more hip-fire headshots in the heat of the moment than you'd expect. Keep your Handling as high as possible - the range difference is fairly negligible from 80-100, we're talking about 1 metre of range literally about 1 step in-game, and Handling is massively important." tags:pvp-god

// The Hothead - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Velocity/Reload] "The Hothead's a completely different beast now that Gjallarhorn's in the mix. Clown Cartridge + Gjally has proven itself to be one of the strongest DPS options in lieu of buffs, and Hothead allows you to bolster this with Field Prep/Ensemble as reliable reload boosters. Outside of Clown, Explosive Light is especially strong, then Vorpal as the backup choice. I think Ensemble could potentially be very strong here, if you're willing to forgo the reserves buff from Field Prep / unable to stay in one uniform position for very long." tags:pve-god

// Hung Jury SR4 - [YeezyGT's S16] god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S16] [MW: Any] "Hung Jury is a fantastic option for high-end content, rivalled in-slot primarily by Night Watch. It really comes down to personal preference - in general, Explosive Rounds on a Scout Rifle is fantastic, Rapid Hit is fantastic, Subsistence is fantastic... Hung Jury's a great workhorse and it can't really steer you wrong. Even on the Adept, I appreciate having a few more bullets in the mag with Backup Mag as I've always been an Overflow Night Watch guy." tags:pve-god

// Peacebond - [YeezyGT's S15] PvP: god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] PvP: [MW: Range / Stability] "This is the Sidearm that even Sidearm-haters love. A lot of great options here - Swashbuckler is always S-Tier on close-range weapons, and even without it you can easily shut down shotgunners both in and out of their operational range. The in-air accuracy as a burst weapon is also very competitive. You'll be surprised at the range you can clean up with this - even without Rangefinder. Pulse Monitor is a strong pick here, along with Killing Wind and Under Pressure giving a helping hand when you're whiffing shots." tags:pvp-god

// IKELOS_SR_v1.0.2 - [YeezyGT's S15] PvE: god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] PvE: [MW: Stability / Reload Speed] "There's a reason you see the IKELOS_SR-v1.0.2 in World's First Raids, low-man challenges and the like. While the efficacy of Warmind Cells are currently being called into question, the IKELOS_SR is just fine without them. 140RPMs sporting mag-refunders like Triple Tap/FTTC and High-Impact Reserves are always going to be fantastic burst damage, and its great to have a Disruption Break roll in your back pocket if we're ever blessed with Anti-Barrier Sniper again. For console players, investing in Stability / recoil direction is going to be slightly more important for consistent shots." tags:pve-god

// Vulpecula - [YeezyGT's S15] PvE: god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] PvE: [MW: Reload / Range] "Vulpecula is a stellar 180. Not only does it deal the extra 5% vs. shields due to its Elemental typing, it maintains the full Kinetic damage coding. In short, it is 5% stronger than every other 180RPM in PvE, blow-for-blow. As for stats, the Reload is a tad sluggish - invest into it, or rely on an Outlaw roll. Explosive Payload is always an S-Tier option, though seems to break Outlaw's registration sometimes - Headstone works as a kind of Stasis-crystal Dragonfly, which just feels great. This is going to be incredibly strong if Overload Hand Cannon becomes a Champion option again in future. tags:pve-god

// Seventh Seraph CQC-12 - [YeezyGT's S15] PvP: god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] PvP: "God, this thing is so good now. People haven't fully caught on. Post-Lightweight buff, the CQC is a fantastic dueling option, with a very small perk pool that lets you pull viable rolls fairly easily. Straight up, [Full Choke/Assault Mag/Slideshot or Quickdraw/Snapshot Sights] is probably your best PvP roll, with Full Choke + Snapshot completely transforming the gun's one-shot-kill potential, and Slideshot allowing for an effective range bump. Vorpal is also great, though you'll be unlikely to land the killing blow with a Lightweight shotgun these days." tags:pvp-god

// Hezen Vengeance Timelost - [YeezyGT's S15] PvE: god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] PvE: [MW: Velocity / Reload Speed] "If you're looking for the best Rocket, you've found it. Don't worry too much about Impact Casing, which ultimately amounts to a 3% damage buff. You'll likely want a few Hezen's for different situations, Overflow/Lasting Impression is incredible for sustained DPS, ALH/Lasting or ALH/Vorpal for Champions, Demolitionist is always great as a secondary auto-reloader, too." tags:pve-god

// Seventh Seraph SAW - [YeezyGT's S15] PvE: god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] PvE: [MW: Stability / Range / Handling] "A personal favourite. While Warmind Cells' efficacy is currently being called into question, the SAW truly doesn't even need them. Auto-Loading Holster is a must for LMGs sorry SWARM, and being able to roll Vorpal Weapon and Disruption Break makes SAW a top-tier pick for GMs. The recoil direction is horrible, but due to the slow firing speed, is easy to work around and plays into the power fantasy somewhat. The thing feels like you're firing a portable tank turret, and does the numbers with a new 20% dmg buff to back it up." tags:pve-god

// Frozen Orbit - [YeezyGT's S15] PvP: god-pvp
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] PvP: [MW: Handling] "This is probably the best-feeling Sniper in the game when it has high-Handling rolls. At 75 stock Recoil Direction, its near-vertical out of the gate. Arrowhead takes this to 100, more noticeable on Console. You have a lot of options with Frozen Orbit -- Surplus + Snapshot is stupidly fast. No Distractions + Opening Shot is a fan favourite for ensuring calculated headshots. Vorpal actually isn't needed, as you should one-shot headshot almost all Supers. High Impact Reserves if you're a body-shot bandit. The perk pool sounds like it would have been a great PvE option, but the mag size simply isn't there -- stick with Uzume." tags:pvp-god

// Eternal Blazon - [YeezyGT's S15] PvE: god-pve
//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] PvE: [MW: ANY] "I've been hunting an Overflow/Disruption Break roll on this gun for so long, that Scouts don't even have a Champion mod anymore. Scopes are mainly personal preference, so I've listed all the short-to-mid-zoom options. Rapid Hit is fantastic here, Quickdraw feels really great too. Some people might be keen on One-for-All, though the mag size is a little restrictive on this to make use of it. Great feeling gun, lots of potential, very little competition as an Arc Scout Rifle." tags:pve-god

// Love and Death - [YeezyGT's S15] PvE: god-pve
//notes: [MW: Velocity] "Love and Death is fantastically versatile, and currently the easiest HGL to farm for, full stop. Pre-S15, this would have been the best future-proof HGL for DPS should they ever be buffed, with the ability to stack your mag with Clown Cartridge, auto-reload, and sporting tied-highest Velocity for 150RPMs. You will [always] want Spike Grenades, at a massive 50% damage increase, then Quick/Hard Launch depending on your Handling preference. Full Court is great in theory, but inconsistent due to the accuracy at range required, so super situational. Demolitionist is great for auto-reloading mid-DPS, and Chain Reaction makes it a fantastic workhorse for general use. tags: god-pve tags:pve-god

Don't worry too much about Impact Casing, which ultimately amounts to a 3% damage buff. You'll likely want a few Hezen's for different situations, Overflow/Lasting Impression is incredible for sustained DPS, ALH/Lasting or ALH/Vorpal for Champions, Demolitionist is always great as a secondary auto-reloader, too." tags:pve-god

//notes: [YeezyGT's S15] PvE: [MW: Handling / Stability] "Don't ever let me see you manually reloading an LMG. Stack up Reconstruction with a mag extender, and you've a match made in heaven. Rampage absolutely mows through enemies, Dragonfly if you want a little more flavour. The beauty of this LMG is how stable it is -- invest in Handling and Stability and you're onto a winner. Very Hammerhead-esque, but in a much nicer form factor." tags:pve-god

//notes: You may not like it, but Polygonal + Demo + OS with a stability mw is the new pinnacle of PvP Slugs. Thanks to absolutely crazy stats, Quick Charge and Opening Shot, one can run around with 100 Range from Opening Shot, 100 Handling with Quick Charge and a massive 95 stability to resist incoming flinch.

//notes: While unfortunately Long Arm hasn’t quite stacked up as the Legendary  Dead Man’s Tale, it still shines in it’s own niche. While normally I’d suggest Rapid Hit over all others, the long reload time means that Rapid Hit falls off after only a couple of bullets reloaded. Either go into Wellspring and commit to Scout Reloaders and reload boosters, or run with Compulsive Reloader and try not go below half ammo. tags:pve-god

//notes: While not beating out Pardon Our Dust for availability or in it’s perkpool, Militia’s can work as a replacement to the now unobtainable Grenade Launcher “Ignition Code”, which could roll with Slideshot. With Slideways’ cooldown timer being longer than Slideshot it cannot pull off the same mass blinding as Ignition could, but it can still send two blinding grenades down range faster than any other launcher without a “slide” perk. tags:pve-god

//notes: While Under Your Skin rolls the classic combo of Archers Tempo + Explosive Head, it might be worth for some people to forgo the slight damage increase of Explosive and instead go for an Adaptive Munitions roll. This perk allows the bow to essentially ignore Match Game, as it gives an eventual 600% damage increase against non-Void elemental shields. With an Adaptive Munitions roll, you could theoretically delete all other elemental bows and only use an Under Your Skin god roll and still be just as effective. An excellent vault cleaning roll. tags:pve-god

//notes: In PvP Eyasluna does not reach the same ranges that Adept Fate can, while still “wasting” a perk slot on Rangefinder. However this allows it to reach into more interesting builds while not focusing wholly on range. If you prefer the feel of Eyasluna then a Rangefinder + Moving Target roll is the play for the range, but Unrelenting is a surprisingly good 6s perk, while Demo can be used to better use your now slower charging grenades. tags:pvp-god

//notes: The premier PvP fusion, with multiple excellent rolls. As long as you have a max zoom scope this gun can shine, but Firmly Planted + Rangefinder pushes the map range out the furthest with HIR offering a more forgiving weapon and Under Pressure being an excellent substitute for Firmly Planted. tags:pvp-god

While Voltshot is interesting on a Grenade Launcher, we already have a Lighweight add clear grenade launcher in Salvagers Salvo - which this wont come close to.

//notes: Of the 140 HCs, Waking has a lower base range at 38 therefore it cannot really be a max range weapon, however, it does have great base handling. Due to the inability to fight at the extended ranges of 140s, sight choice can come down to which is preferred visually. Despite this, the sights which are normally ignored because of the stat penalties they incur Sureshot & Crossfire can be worth it to push the range out as far as possible. tags:pvp-god

//notes: This handcannon is stacked with good PvP perks, and there very nearly isn’t a bad perk combination on the weapon. The suggested EotS + Opening Shot roll is excellent for 1 on 1 dueling, giving accuracy boosts at practically every part of the gunfight, but it’s not alone at the top. Some other suggested perk combinations; EotS + Rangefinder to duel at 35m, HFG + Opening Shot for closer range primary, Compulsive Reloader + Moving Target to reduce flinch and improve passive aa as much as possible, the possibilities are tremendous. Cantana has a low recoil direction of 85 hand canons have a floor of 80 so arrowhead would be a best in slot pick. tags:pvp-god

//notes: An average adaptive frame made interesting by a couple of new perks, but not far and away better than current offerings. Grab a Cold Steel roll if that perk interests you, and Duelist’s Trance is a perk that can see some play in improving dps at the cost of not having the ammo economy of Relentless assuming you get a kill before going at the boss. PvP: It’s a sword in PvP, you don’t care about the roll tags:pve-god

//notes: The best PvP energy 140 handcannon, hands down. A high range roll with some points into stability is excellent, though if you managed to keep a Bottomless Grief + HIR roll then the 2c1b is nothing to scoff at. With how good Pally’s bases stats are, it would be worth putting some points into stability. It’s so close at base to get the sweet spot of 65-70 stab for a well balanced roll. tags:pvp-god

//notes: The Aggressive Frame Pulse Rifle returns in another raid weapon, along with it comes the old roll of Dragonfly + Damage Perk, this time with a new final column winner in One for All.

//notes: This Hand Cannon cannot have a one and done God Roll for PvP. Practically every perk other than Vorpal is an S tier Crucible perk, and to lock you into my favourite roll is doing Rose an injustice. This is a gun where you need to experiment and find out what your god roll is. For some suggestions I’d look into Moving Target + Rangefinder for consistency and range, Slideshot + EotS for moving from duel to duel and Perpetual Motion + Explosive Payload for consistency and dueling within a closer range - but this gun will shine best in your hands with your build on it. Maximise the stats and get the engagement range above 30m and this will be hands down the best PvP Hand cannon in the Kinetic Slot tags:pvp-god

//notes: This sniper used to be excellent with Quickdraw, but with the changes removing the ads speed from Quickdraw it needs to be replaced. Surplus gives a handling increase, but it’s not the same as the old Quickdraw. If you’re getting your handling from other places, then Slideshot is best in slot for the range increase. tags:pvp-god

//notes: The monster shotgun returns, this time with a crappy perk pool. Aggressive shotguns are in a rough spot right now, with only Timelost Found Verdict reaching ohk ranges longer than Lightweights. Without a stacked stat package and no Opening Shot, Mindbenders lacks any of the things that can let Aggressives compete in this meta. Despite having a better handling perk than Found Verdict, it cannot stack up in any other way. tags:pvp-god

//notes: The monster shotgun returns, this time with a crappy perk pool. Aggressive shotguns are in a rough spot right now, with only Timelost Found Verdict reaching ohk ranges longer than Lightweights. Without a stacked stat package and no Opening Shot, Mindbenders lacks any of the things that can let Aggressives compete in this meta. Despite having a better handling perk than Found Verdict, it cannot stack up in any other way. tags:pvp-god

//notes: Frontier’s Cry is the only 180 that can reach 140 dueling ranges thanks to Iron Reach, making it unique in that regard. Unfortunately it still suffers from the issues innate to 180s that keep them out of the meta, so I still suggest going for a Kill Clip roll to get a 3 tap cannon in the energy slot if you can only keep a single roll tags:pvp-god

//notes: While no longer as powerful as it used to be, Felwinters is still a guaranteed excellent roll on a still competitive shotgun frame in PvP. Surplus has become even less useful with the ability nerf, so personally I’d go all in on consistency and run Slideshot + Opening Shot. There are much better shotguns for PvE, but Felwinters does have a consistent roll with at least a good damage perk if you have nothing better. tags:pvp-god

//notes: A new contender for the best PvP Sniper in the energy slot. 45 Zoom with Snapshot + Opening Shot makes it spectacular and while the 72 rpm archetype may put off some people it’s still a very good archetype. Maxing out handling is probably preferred after the snapshot nerf, but the origin trait can go a good way to making the gun feel good if you like to hit wideflanks. tags:pvp-god

//notes: Revision Zero is another extremely customisable exotic, with many choices for the perks. The biggest choices outside of stat perks is whether to go for the two shot Heavy Burst or the four shot Light Burst. In general this is another choice for the player - the two burst tends to be better in general but stacks the exotic perk much slower, while the four burst is slightly worse for general usage but stacks the exotic perk much faster. tags:pvp-god

//notes: The best PvP energy 140 handcannon, hands down. A high range roll with some points into stability is excellent, though if you managed to keep a Bottomless Grief + HIR roll then the 2c1b is nothing to scoff at. With how good Pally’s bases stats are, it would be worth putting some points into stability. It’s so close at base to get the sweet spot of 65-70 stab for a well balanced roll. tags:pvp-god

//notes: A High Impact MG worth getting for PvE. The return of Killing Tally allows this MG to put in excellent work clearing ads when combined with the 40% s16 MG buff against non-boss enemies. This is the current pick for a Solar MG in GMs, whether that’s with Incandescent to pair with a Solar 3.0 build, or with Killing Tally to enhance its add clearing power tags:pve-god

//notes: A pulse with a huge number of excellent PvE rolls that is let down by the horrendous archetype for both PvE and PvP. Despite it’s low damage, it rolls with Demo + Wellspring for ability builds, and Adaptive Munitions + Dbreak/Turnabout for shield breaking, but I wouldn’t use it over other pulse rifles that deal more base damage in more difficult content like GMs or Master Raids. tags:pve-god

//notes: A solid Precision shotgun for PvP, which is unfortunately overshadowed by the strength of the Matador. Run Smallbore and Accurized with a Range mw to maximize the range without dropping Handling. Unfortunately Precisions are struggling in the high resilience meta we find ourselves in, needing an extra pellet to kill on 6 resilience and higher. tags:pvp-god

//notes: With the change to precision fusions in S16, Adaptives have risen in strength. Normally killing in 5 bolts at 6 resilience and below, High Impact Reserves or a charge time increase can make it 5 bolt all resilience and 9 resilience respectively. Then it’s a matter of improving the recoil direction to be as vertical as possible and getting as much stability and accuracy as you can. This is an excellent PvP fusion if you can just get a good roll on it. tags:pvp-god

Because it has more range? pushing a 60 stat SMG to 20M base range. Deciding between Kill Clip and Iron Reach comes down to deciding what you want your smg to be. Iron Reach gives it an extra 3m of range and with smgs, every metre counts making it a better dueling weapon, while Kill Clip’s damage buff gives it a nutty ttk and an excellent snowball machine. tags:pvp-god

//notes: Despite Iron Reach greatly increasing the range, this gun has to stand up against the stat monster that is Palindrome. Even while fully statted into Range, it loses to Pali by 3m. While this might be an alternative for those who dislike the zoom that Rangefinder gives, it’s better off being used on an Arc Subclass with Elemental Capacitor for a huge Handling stat or relegated to the trash. tags:pvp-god

//notes: Opening Shot is arguably the best in slot perk. Rangefinder is generally the go to it does add ~3M of base range but Hawkmoon is a run and gun weapon in my opinion - if you want range, run a 120 or Luna Faction boots. Opening Shot gives a serious bonus to accuracy on ground and in air and helps guarantee landing the first crit or 7 stack OHKO if you wait for perk to reset. Moving Target is nearly worthless due to high base AA stat. tags:pvp-god

//notes: A weapon to match up against Palindrome as the new best PvP Energy Handcannon. With good PvE rolls, this gun truly shines in PvP. With a huge number of PvP perks, a pure dueling roll with Rangefinder and EotS might be the best for general use - but you can get a lot of work out of many of the more kill focused perks tags:pvp-god

//notes: This gun can get some really nice rolls, but the most important part is Kill Clip, allowing it to two tap after the damage nerf, depending on how the gun feels for you, the split minor stat boost barrels and steady rounds can help to make up for the terrible base stats. tags:pvp-god

This pairs extremely well with an Auto Loading Heavy weapon if you want to use an exotic primary, or even just as an alternative to a Triple Tap sniper to eliminate reload time note, Triple Tap is still superior to Overflow if you hit all crits thanks to pulling ammo from thin air instead of taking from reserves tags:pve-god

//notes: The God Combo of Quickdraw + Snapshot returns on a 90 rpm sniper. Personally I’d go all in on Handling with a Qd + Snap sniper, to help with the stow speed and attempt to match the old version of Quickdraw as closely as possible potentially even using Quick Access Sling if you can justify the loss of the option of air shots. Despite the return of the old combo, don’t discount Firmly Planted as an excellent accuracy booster when crouching. tags:pvp-god

//notes: Smallbore and Accurized work together to reach 60 range, important for the consistent ohk range of 6-7m on Aggressive frames. As the only Kinetic Aggressive shotgun with Elemental Capacitor, this rules the slot on an Arc subclass. However being able to keep Frenzy procc’d through constant combat in 6s or peakshooting and other chip damage methods would give a huge boost to handling and an excellent damage buff for defensive shotgunning. My personal take is for Ele cap and use a different shotgun on Arc, but if you can keep Frenzy running in those important moments this shotgun can bis for all subclasses. tags:pvp-god

// Indebted Kindness PvE backup roll
// Volatile Launch, Confined Launch, Linear Compensator, Tactical Mag, Extended Mag, Appended Mag, Lead From Gold, Beacon Rounds, Loose Change, Permeability
//notes: Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 90 https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C3Wx7xXVw10WshiLn5sT8?si=ZNEiHi_ZRfW5z3BbkOMrVQ with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways, and @Saint_Kabr. Backup PvE pick for Major Spec enemies particularly for Void Gyrfalcon Hunters in end-game content. Indebted Kindness is the first ever Rocket-Assisted Frame sidearm, so there's no comparison possible. It seems to be a weird mix of sidearm and grenade launcher, which hits like a truck. Blast Radius seems to be the most impactful stat so any of the barrel perks that help boost it are viable. For similar reasons, High-Explosive Ordnance is the top choice for the mag perk. The new-to-Season 23 Permeability trait in the second trait column means, if you're running Gyrfalcons, you can use Indebted Kindness to apply volatility at will - making this really strong against Barrier Champions as well as for add clear. You can pair this with Lead From Gold to help with ammo economy, Beacond Rounds for strong enemy tracking or Loose Change for speedy reloads, if you're using Gambler's Dodge. The origin trait is situationally useful if you're in a construct-heavy environment, like the Warlord's Ruin dungeon itself.

// Mechabre PvE backup roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling, Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag, Perpetual Motion, Voltshot
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 37. PvE backup roll for building into Arc 3.0 subclasses. The Origin Trait, gaining better ADS and strafe speed when on your own, might be useful when you're away from your fireteam, but think of it more as a useful added extra when it's procced. Direct competitor to Occluded Finality, but with a much more reasonable 45 Zoom. You don't really need to worry about range, so look to boost Handling with the barrel. You want to make your reloads as fast as possible, so Flared Magwell or Tactical Mag are you mag choices. In the first trait column, Perpetual Motion boosts Reload Speed even more so that when you get your first add kill, you can reload as fast as possible to proc Jolt with Voltshot in the second column for additional damage against a Major or Boss and add clear of any Minors nearby. This is as close as you'll get to a legendary Cloudstrike. Recommended MW: Reload Speed, with a damage-boosting Major, Boss or Taken Spec mod.

// Retold Tale PvE backup roll
// Full Choke, Barrel Shroud, Fluted Barrel, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Tactical Mag, Assault Mag, Appended Mag, Extended Mag, Slideshot, Field Prep, Lead From Gold, One-Two Punch
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 23. PvE backup roll for end-game content. Still worth looking at, even without an origin perk, with the update 4.1.5 buff to pellet shotguns. For boss damage, Full Choke keeps pellets together. Assault Mag helps with a follow-up shot if you miss a pellet, or Tactical Mag, Appended or Extended Mag all give the same +1 to mag size. Slideshot gets you reloads on the fly, Field Prep helps with both inventory or reloads, or Lead From Gold saves you running a finder/scavenger perk. One-Two Punch is still good for major and boss damage - if you can get close enough!

// Indebted Kindness PvE backup roll
// Volatile Launch, Confined Launch, Linear Compensator, Tactical Mag, Extended Mag, Appended Mag, Impulse Amplifier, Loose Change, Voltshot
//notes: Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 90 https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C3Wx7xXVw10WshiLn5sT8?si=ZNEiHi_ZRfW5z3BbkOMrVQ with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways, and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for Major Spec enemies particularly for Arc subclasses in end-game content. Indebted Kindness is the first ever Rocket-Assisted Frame sidearm, so there's no comparison possible. It seems to be a weird mix of sidearm and grenade launcher, which hits like a truck. Blast Radius seems to be the most impactful stat so any of the barrel perks that help boost it are viable. More shots = more fun, so any of the mag-boosting perks can work as the mag perk. Voltshot, as the second trait perk, should make it easy to apply Jolt to a target and help clear adds quickly, but relies on a fast reload - Impulse Amplifier as the first trait perk helps all the time or, after your first application of Voltshot, Loose Change boosts reload speed by 50. Throw on other fragments like Spark of Beacons for additional blinding to suppress adds, or Ions/Discharge to feed your abilities and this could be a top choice for crowd control. The origin trait is situationally useful if you're in a construct-heavy environment, like the Warlord's Ruin dungeon itself.

// Indebted Kindness PvE backup roll
// Volatile Launch, Confined Launch, Linear Compensator, Tactical Mag, Extended Mag, Appended Mag, Lead From Gold, Beacon Rounds, Adagio
//notes: Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 90 https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C3Wx7xXVw10WshiLn5sT8?si=ZNEiHi_ZRfW5z3BbkOMrVQ with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways, and @Saint_Kabr. Backup PvE pick for Major Spec enemies particularly for Arc subclasses in end-game content. Indebted Kindness is the first ever Rocket-Assisted Frame sidearm, so there's no comparison possible. It seems to be a weird mix of sidearm and grenade launcher, which hits like a truck. Blast Radius seems to be the most impactful stat so any of the barrel perks that help boost it are viable. More shots = more fun, so any of the mag-boosting perks can work as the mag perk. As the second trait perk, Adagio is a net damage increase after a kill, even with the slower firing rate, so pair that with Lead From Gold to keep the ammo flowing, or the new to Season 23 Beacon Rounds for strong enemy tracking. Throw on other fragments like Spark of Beacons for additional blinding to suppress adds, or Ions/Discharge to feed your abilities and this could be a top choice for crowd control. The origin trait is situationally useful if you're in a construct-heavy environment, like the Warlord's Ruin dungeon itself. Recommended MW: Blast Radius, with a damage boosting Major or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-boss, pve-major, pve-endgame, mkb, controller

// Dragoncult Sickle PvE backup roll
// Honed Edge, Tempered Edge, Swordmaster's Guard, Slice, Surrounded, Whirlwind Blade
//notes: Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 90 https://open.spotify.com/episode/7C3Wx7xXVw10WshiLn5sT8?si=ZNEiHi_ZRfW5z3BbkOMrVQ with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways, and @Saint_Kabr. Backup PvE pick for Major and Boss Spec enemies particularly for Strand subclasses in end-game content. This is the first new Caster-Frame sword we've seen in some time, and the first Strand one. Dungeon weapons tend to have better stats than world drops, and Dragoncult Sickle is no exception, having pretty good overall stats - both Impact and Ammo Capacity are higher than its peers. The advantage you have with caster frames is that you can hit from range with the heavy attack, but the ammo cost as at v7.3.0.3 is still a little high. On the other hand, you can use it for major or boss damage - the standard Impact-boosting blade for the extra damage and Swordmaster's Guard for the Guard perk still apply. The new-to-Season-23 Slice as the first trait perk gives this an ability to sever a major or a boss, reducing its outgoing damage by 40% for 10s or 15s with Thread of Continuity, which can be a lifesaver in a CQC fight. In the second trait column as the signature perk, you could go for Surrounded, if you know there will be adds around to boost damage by 40%, or Whirlwind Blade if there aren't. The origin trait is situationally useful if you're in a construct-heavy environment, like the Warlord's Ruin dungeon itself.

// Cold Comfort PvE first-choice roll
// Quick Launch, Impact Casing, Envious Assassin, Explosive Light, Bait and Switch, Bipod
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 67 https://open.spotify.com/episode/3wGaXiUGMNodLkPkGFdBd3?si=42e0db2e63a443b7 with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. First-choice PvE pick for burst damage against Majors and Bosses in end-game activities. Cold Comfort has decent stats, including ammo reserves so you can get to 10 host with three reserve mods. This could be a sleeper pick for burst damage against Major enemies, and against boss enemies with short damage windows. Aggressives are the fastest-firing subfamily, in the group with the highest damage per shot. Quick Launch is the usual play for the barrel, to improve velocity. For as high a damage output as possible, Impact Casing boosts overall damage by 2.2% doesn't sound much but remember, any mutilplicative damage starts adding up. Envious Assassin, in the first trait slot as the support perk, can get you 3 in the mag from six rapid kills - let's just say they just all fit in the barrel paracausally - and if you have the Restoration Ritual origin trait procced, that'll be four shots without reloading. Bait and Switch provides the highest damage boost - 35% when procced, but needs some setup, or Explosive Light is a 25% damage boost just for picking up some orbs. As a left-field pick though, don't throw away a bipod roll - it'll only take a small change to the perk to make it extremely competitive, doubling the barrel capacity and adding 5 to your reserves. That could mean seven shots without reloading, if you include the origin trait...

Backup PvE pick for burst damage against Majors in end-game content. Shapeable. As at S21, A Distant Pull is the only non-raid kinetic rapid-fire sniper rifle. As you might expect, it comes with lower stats but it's still usable if you can fill the gaps. Fluted Barrel and Tactical Mag fill out Handling, Stability, Reload Speed and also max out the magazine size to 7. If you can reliably hit crits, you can get 10 shots off without reloading with Triple Tap as a first trait column support park. As a second column signature perk, Explosive Payload or Collective Action both add additional damage for burst DPS against Majors, and the occasional sustained damage phase against a boss.

// Taraxippos PvE backup roll
// Chambered Compensator, Extended Barrel, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Zen Moment, Fourth Time's The Charm, Explosive Payload
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 61 https://open.spotify.com/episode/35xKd0TwFvvOyymsE9Wp5H with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. Backup PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities. Named after a ghost that frightened horses at a particular spot on the Olympia race course during ancient games there. Our first Lightweight Strand scout rifle has only one direct kinetic slot competitor in Night Watch, and is pretty comparable in stats, although will do 10% less damage, as a non-kinetic weapon. For min-maxxers, the +30 Mobility from the intrinsic perk can help to flesh out builds. Taraxippos is fast-firing, so you will need to tidy up the 54 Recoil Direction. Chambered Compensator or Extended Barrel will get you to a slightly better 64. In the magazine, Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell both offer useful boosts to stability and reload speed and an extra shot for Tac Mag. If you're still finding the recoil difficult, you can proc all 5 stacks of Zen Moment with just three hits, in the first trait column as your support perk. If you're not finding it a problem, than Fourth Time's The Charm is always welcome to extend your mag size, while Explosive Payload in the second column as the signature perk adds 30% damage with no falloff, and is useful when Scouts are the seasonal anti-Overload Champion mod, only needing two shots to disrupt. The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful - who would say no to extra class ability energy? Or, Omolon Fluid Dynamics adds stability and reload speed to the top half of your mag. Recommended MW: Range, Stability or Handling - just go with your preference, with a damage-boosting Minor or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-champion, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 57 https://open.spotify.com/episode/3LOWj7jLe0eiacDYwEbK22 with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. Backup PvE roll for Light subclass synergy against Majors in end-game content. While slug shotguns aren't the burst damage meta they once were, they can still deal decent damage when the occasion demands. For the barrel, stability is a bit more important than normal, to keep your reticule on target, but Handling is still useful too. Appended Mag adds a shot, which is always a good thing, as your magazine perk. As your first trait column support perk, Demolitionist means grenades remember, it's 20% grenade energy for special weapon kills, which means you should have an easy way to proc Paracausal Affinity for 20% bonus damage for 6s to clear beefier Minors, and Majors. The Harmonic Resonance origin trait can boost damage still further by a stacking 3.33% with one other RoN Raid weapon or 10% with two.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. Backup PvE roll for end-game content. Shapeable. The Ambush origin trait is probably more for PvP than PvE, with the extra range, handling and 10% boost to damage for a few moments after combat starts but will be more use for a glaive than Hakke Breach Armaments. JoK is a new subtype for Season 19 - a slower, but harder hitting slashy shooty stick than we're used to. You're going to be in CQC, where projectile speed governed by range isn't quite as important, and the shield can be quite useful to survive in a crowd. Use your haft to improve charge time and shield duration, and take the extra shot from Appended Mag Extended Mag gives you no more shots so isn't worth it, or the faster reload and extra range from Light Mag. In the first trait column, Overflow on a Special or Power weapon is just so good - more than double your magazine size and it bypasses the low reload speed just for picking up a brick! Pair that with the newly buffed Surrounded for a ridiculous 40% 47% for the Enhanced version bonus to projectile damage for just for being near three enemies.

// Judgment of Kelgorath PvE backup roll
// Auxilliary Reserves, Low Impedence Windings, Appended Mag, Light Mag, Overflow, Unstoppable Force
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. Backup PvE roll for end-game content. Shapeable. The Ambush origin trait is probably more for PvP than PvE, with the extra range, handling and 10% boost to damage for a few moments after combat starts but will be more use for a glaive than Hakke Breach Armaments. JoK is a new subtype for Season 19 - a slower, but harder hitting slashy shooty stick than we're used to. You're going to be in CQC, where projectile speed governed by range isn't quite as important, and the shield can be quite useful to survive in a crowd. Use your haft to improve charge time and shield duration, and take the extra shot from Appended Mag Extended Mag gives you no more shots so isn't worth it, or the faster reload and extra range from Light Mag. In the first trait column, Overflow on a Special or Power weapon is just so good - more than double your magazine size and it bypasses the low reload speed just for picking up a brick! Unstoppable Force then gives a 30% damage bonus to projectiles for blocking with your shield, letting you tank damage and take on beefier adds and Majors.

// Retrofit Escapade PvE backup roll
// Fluted Barrel, Polygonal Rifling, Extended Mag, Appended Mag, Field Prep, Fourth Time's the Charm, Target Lock
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. Backup PvE roll for end-game content. Shapeable. The Ambush origin trait is probably more for PvP than PvE, with the extra range, handling and 10% boost to damage for a few moments after combat starts, although Suros Synergy's flinch reduction in reload is useful in a firefight too so take your pick. This is better in every stat than the only other rapid fire LMG - Shattered Cypher - and there are a few ways you can go with a weapon build. You'll need to control your fire with short bursts - so, to make it easier, tighten things up with additional stability. For damage against a single target, you want your magazine as large as it will go, so look for Extended or Appended. Then extend the magazine with Fourth Time's the Charm, or improve your ammo reserves and reload with Field Prep in the first trait column to give Target Lock's 40& bonus to damage as much uptime as possible.

// Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling, Appended Mag, Clown Cartridge, Vorpal Weapon, High-Impact Reserves
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 37. PvE backup roll for burst damage against Majors. The Origin Trait, gaining better ADS and strafe speed when on your own, might be useful when you're away from your fireteam, but think of it more as a useful added extra when it's procced. Direct competitor to Occluded Finality, but with a much more reasonable 45 Zoom. You don't really need to worry about range, so look to boost Handling with the barrel. It's difficult to get to five in the mag to make Triple Tap proc twice, so go for Appended Mag instead to add an extra round. In the first trait column, Clown Cartridge boosts magazine size by a shot or two on reload, and in the second column, Vorpal Weapon adds 15% damage against Majors, Bosses and vehicles or High-Impact Reserves will add up to 25% bonus damage once you get past the second bullet.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE backup roll for burst damage against bosses and Champions in end-game content. Shapeable. An end-game LFR that you don't need to complete a Raid, Dungeon or Trials for, which works for both burst and sustained damage, especially with the Veist Stinger origin trait throwing in extra shots for free at random. A Handling barrel just makes using it snappier, and Enhanced Battery with Backup Mag gets you to the seven shots in your battery, to give the origin trait more chances to proc, especially with the extra shots from Clown Cartridge. Alternatively, Field Prep gives you extra reserves and faster reloads for sustained damage. For Raid bosses or static bosses, where you'll be in a fireteam as a group, Firing Line adds a solid 20% bonus damage.

Backup PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content, particularly with a solar subclass. If you find a roll you like, keep for the ability to enhance perks when Final Shape arrives. Luna's Howl was changed from a Precision to an Adaptive back in the day, so the stats do look weird in comparison to its peers - it's stable and easy to use, but might feel strange if you're used to traditional 140 HCs. Take a barrel perk that gives you a little bit of everything to round things out - Corkscrew, Smallbore or Fluted. If you miss out on a reload mag perk, then any of the combat effect perks will work, but you might benefit from a solar reload armor mod or two. There's really only one trait perk combination to search for - Heal Clip hence the need for reload speed and Incandescent. Great anyway, but even better when synergising with solar fragments. The Indomitability origin trait seems built for the Prismatic subclass, generating grenade or melee energy according to your subclass type.

Backup PvE pick for add-clearing Minor Spec enemies in end-game content. Undercurrent is a decent choice for an arc wave-frame grenade launcher if you don't have access to a Forbearance. The stats are worse - it's not an end-game weapon so that's to be expected. Blast Radius has no meaningful effect, so maximise velocity, and try to help handling with the barrel perk. High-Velocity Rounds as the mag perk also usefully helps reload speed ut a bit too. For the first trait perk Left From Gold or Demolitionist are both solid choices, while to boost damage in the second trait column One for All or Adrenaline Junkie should both help deal with bulkier adds.

// Waking Vigil PvE first-choice roll
// Smallbore, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Extended Barrel, Full Bore, Armor-Piercing Rounds, High-Calibre Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Subsistence, Kinetic Tremors, Attrition Orbs, Rapid Hit, Perpetual Motion, Dragonfly
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 91 https://open.spotify.com/episode/50NPk7xF3Tt6X3DVucE9jU?si=44d2b7d44a5a4aec with @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for add-clear of Minor Spec enemies in general content. As a former Lightweight HC that's been crowbarred into the Adaptive subfamily, the stats look very weird, with low range and stability but high handling and reload speed. If you haven't already got a decent arc hand cannon, then you could push out the range a bit, even at the cost of a little Handling, and add a little Stability. Any of the combat effect rounds in the mag perk slot Armor-Piercing, High-Caliber or Ricochet Rounds will add a tiny bit more range and utility in a firefight. Rapid Hit is the best support perk choice in the first column traits, although Perpetual Motion isn't bad either. Dragonfly in the second trait column as the signature perk is great for thinning out add crowds when you're hitting crits. The Advanced Reflexes origin trait is quite useful in PvE - when activated by an enemy hit, it adds +30 Handling for additional ready and ADS speed, together with a handy +20 Mobility, for 7.5s. Recommended MW: Range or Stability, with a damage boosting Minor or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, mkb, controller

// Brya's Love PvE backup roll
Fluted Barrel, Smnallbore, Polygonal Rifling, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Rapid Hit, Perpetual Motion, Explosive Payload, Frenzy, Golden Tricorn
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 76 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4UoXFYD3DbunDEKIGDiriX?si=1957400d9e024ed5 with @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. Backup PvE pick for Minor Spec enemies in end-game content - only keep if you don't have an existing well-rolled void scout rifle. Shapeable. Brya's Love - named after Eris's Ghost - is up against Doom of Chelchis as a void precision frame scout rifle so, as you'd expect, doesn't fare well in a straight stat comparison. There are still some useful and unique trait combinations available to craft. For the barrel perk, Fluted Barrel or Smallbore are probably your top two choices - as a precision frame, the recoil direction stat doesn't really matter - or you could opt to go all into Stability with Polygonal Rifling or range with Hammer-Forged Rifling. For the magazine perk, Tactical Mag is the best choice, or possibly Appended mag of one more shot. As your support trait, Rapid Hit or Perpetual Motion both add decent gunfeel boosts, while Explosive Payload, Frenzy or Golden Tricorn all work in end-game activities to boost damage. Whether you find the Head Rush origin trait useful will depend on how often you crouch and get up again - if you do, the additional handling and reload speed is useful, if not game-changing. Recommended MW: Stability, with a damage-boosting Minor or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, mkb, controller

// The Eremite PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Enhanced Battery, Cure Clip, Reservoir Burst
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 76 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4UoXFYD3DbunDEKIGDiriX?si=1957400d9e024ed5 with @Saint_Kabr and @ImpetusAlways. First-choice PvE pick for support builds in end-game content. Shapeable. The Eremite named after a religious recluse, being the root for the word hermit, is a bit of a season 21 banger! Although the stats are below average, this should be on your list of weapons you aim to farm and craft. Fluted Barrel as the barrel perk bumps up handling and adds a dash of stability, and Enhanced Battery adds an additional shot. For support builds in end-game content, the new to season 21 Cure Clip as the support perk in the first trait slot, provides group healing on a reload after a kill - in the second, signature perk, trait slot Reservoir Burst adds 25% burst damage when the battery's full, adds the fun explosions, and needs a reload afterwards anyway to get it ready for next time, so works well as a combination. Whether you find the Head Rush origin trait useful will depend on how often you crouch and get up again - if you do, the additional handling and reload speed is useful, if not game-changing.

// New Pacific Epitaph PvE backup roll
// Hard Launch, Linear Compensator, Smart Drift Control, High-Velocity Rounds, Demolitionist, Lead From Gold, Unrelenting, Collective Action
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 67 https://open.spotify.com/episode/3wGaXiUGMNodLkPkGFdBd3?si=42e0db2e63a443b7 with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. Backup PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities. New Pacific Epitaph is the first kinetic slot wave frame grenade launcher, so there's no direct comparison, but compared to the energy slot versions the stats are decent. As ever, play is to get the shot speed as high as you can, so Quick Launch in the barrel and High-Velocity Rounds in the magazine are the best choices. For use against endgame minor adds, as the first trait column support perk Demolitionist which returns 20% grenade energy on special weapons, and allows for an instant reload on a grenade throw, or Lead from Gold for ammo economy, or Unrelenting to help you stay alive all work well. In the second column as the signature Perk, Collective Action should be easy to proc with all the Elemental Pickups now available, for a 20% damage boost for 7s. The Restoration Ritual origin trait is also occasionally useful for an instant reload after proccing. Recommended MW: Velocity, with a damage-boosting Minor or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

// Cold Comfort PvE backup roll
// Hard Launch, Linear Compensator, Smart Drift Control, Impact Casing, Envious Assassin, Explosive Light, Bait and Switch, Bipod
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 67 https://open.spotify.com/episode/3wGaXiUGMNodLkPkGFdBd3?si=42e0db2e63a443b7 with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. Backup PvE pick for burst damage against Majors and Bosses in end-game activities. Cold Comfort has decent stats, including ammo reserves so you can get to 10 host with three reserve mods. This could be a sleeper pick for burst damage against Major enemies, and against boss enemies with short damage windows. Aggressives are the fastest-firing subfamily, in the group with the highest damage per shot. First, a velocity-boosting perk is the usual play for the barrel. Impact Casing boosts overall damage by 2.2% doesn't sound much but remember, any mutilplicative damage starts adding up. Envious Assassin, in the first trait slot as the support perk, can get you 3 in the mag from six rapid kills - let's just say they just all fit in the barrel paracausally - and if you have the Restoration Ritual origin trait procced, that'll be four shots without reloading. Bait and Switch provides the highest damage boost - 35% when procced, but needs some setup, or Explosive Light is a 25% damage boost just for picking up some orbs. As a left-field pick though, don't throw away a bipod roll - it'll only take a small change to the perk to make it extremely competitive, doubling the barrel capacity and adding 5 to your reserves. That could mean seven shots without reloading, if you include the origin trait... Recommended MW: Velocity, with a damage-boosting Major, Boss or Taken Spec. tags:pve, pve-boss, pve-major, controller, mkb

// Thin Precipice PvE backup roll
// Jagged Edge, Swordmaster's Guard, Relentless Strikes, Collective Action
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 61 https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XT0gPkoVSh3cM6gMtSupq?si=18db495353ca49ad with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. Backup PvE pick for burst damage to Majors in end-game content. Shapeable. Thin Precipice is the first Strand sword, and is the fan-favourite vortex spin-to-win frame to boot. As with all swords, Jagged Edge is the usual choice for the blade for its increased damage and Swordmaster's Guard to reduce the time it takes for your heavy attack to charge. For burst damage against Majors, Relentless Strikes in the first column as the support park refunds ammo after three hits and, after collecting an Elemental pickup you'll have 7s with a 20% boost to damage.

// The Title PvE backup roll
// Full Bore, Extended Barrel, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Ricochet Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, High-Calibre Rounds, Threat Detector, Perpetual Motion, Surrounded
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 61 https://open.spotify.com/episode/35xKd0TwFvvOyymsE9Wp5H with @Saint_Kabr, @CourtProjects and @ImpetusAlways. Backup PvE pick for minor add clear in endgame activities. Unfortunately, this doesn't have great stats or any unique perk options by comparison with other aggressive frame SMGs, but drops will rain down during Guardian Games, so that's not unexpected maybe it's just Hakke's unfamiliarity with energy weapons 😉. Season 20 has lost the S-Tier Stats/One for All combination, unfortunately. If you want to tuck one away, push out the range with your barrel and magazine, even at the cost of stability or handling, as we'll be getting that back with the traits, and the Recoil Direction of 85 is pretty much vertical. In the first trait column as your support perk, if you're not proccing Threat Detector's bonus Stability, Handling and Reload Speed, you're just doing it wrong, or Perpetual Motion provides useful, if smaller, boosts as an alternative choice. Similarly with Surrounded as your second column signature perk - although it's not the Enhanced version, you'll still have 40% bonus damage when procced in CQC. The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful - who would say no to extra class ability energy? Or, if you're up against vehicles and constructs, Hakke Breach Armaments will help burst them down.

Our first Lightweight Strand scout rifle has only one direct kinetic slot competitor in Night Watch, and is pretty comparable in stats, although will do 10% less damage, as a non-kinetic weapon. For min-maxxers, the +30 Mobility from the intrinsic perk can help to flesh out builds. Taraxippos is fast-firing, so you will need to tidy up the 54 Recoil Direction. Chambered Compensator or Extended Barrel will get you to a slightly better 64. In the magazine, Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell both offer useful boosts to stability and reload speed and an extra shot for Tac Mag. If you're still finding the recoil difficult, you can proc all 5 stacks of Zen Moment with just three hits, in the first trait column as your support perk. If you're not finding it a problem, than Fourth Time's The Charm is always welcome to extend your mag size, or Outlaw works well for a snappy reload after a crit kill. Then Hatchling in the second column as the signature perk builds into the Strand toolkit - just come to peace that they're likely to be spawned too far away to join you, if you're a Warlock. The Classy Contender Origin Perk is useful - who would say no to extra class ability energy? Or, Omolon Fluid Dynamics adds stability and reload speed to the top half of your mag. Recommended MW: Range, Stability or Handling - just go with your preference, with a damage-boosting Minor or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

// Rufus's Fury PvE backup roll
// Arrowhead Brake, High-Caliber Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Rewind Rounds, Target Lock, Frenzy
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 57 https://open.spotify.com/episode/3LOWj7jLe0eiacDYwEbK22 with @CourtProjects, @ImpetusAlways and @Saint_Kabr. Backup PvE roll for Minor add-clear in end-game content. Shapeable. Most Raid weapons boast stellar stat packages, and Rufus's Fury is no different and will be most people's choice for a Strand primary, and will probably only get better when the additional fragments arrive. Although, at 56, the recoil is pretty up-and-down, Arrowhead Brake as the barrel perk takes the Recoil Direction to an even more controllable 86 and adds Handling. High-Caliber Rounds or Armor-Piercing Rounds add range and either flinch or overpenetration in the mag. Rewind Rounds is the best of the support perks in the first trait column for primary weapons, pairing with signature perks like Target Lock, where the refilled magazine allows you to reach the higher damage stacks, for damage against bulkier enemies or Frenzy for a general 15% damage bump. The Harmonic Resonance origin trait can boost damage still further by a stacking 3.33% with one other RoN Raid weapon or 10% with two. Reccommended MW: Range, Stability or Handling - just go with your preference, with a damage-boosting Minor or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

Backup PvE roll for stasis synergy and end-game content. The first kinetic slot high-impact fusion rifle - it needs handling and stability to improve gunfeel, but it might be worth hanging onto in case the archetype gets a little love. Fusion Rifle range is very constrained, so look for handling with your barrel, and Ionized or Enhanced Battery adds extra shots. Reconstruction then doubles your mag size, and bypasses any reload penalty and means that the top 3/4 of your magazine will now proc Chill Clip. By consistently topping up the magazine you should also benefit from the Omolon origin perk stability boost.

Backup PvE roll for stasis synergy and end-game content. The first kinetic slot high-impact fusion rifle - it needs handling and stability to improve gunfeel, but it might be worth hanging onto in case the archetype gets a little love. Fusion Rifle range is very constrained, so look for handling with your barrel, and Ionized or Enhanced Battery adds extra shots. A full burst of a high-impact fusion will likely kill any red-bar even in end-game content so Subsistence should keep the magazine topped up, or Slideways can bypass any reload speed penalty, to proc Chill Clip. By consistently topping up the magazine you should also benefit from the Omolon origin perk stability boost.

Backup PvE roll for general content. Decent stats by comparison with its peers but, at the end of the day, this is still a sidearm looking for an in-game role. Spec into stability with your barrel, and High-Cal Rounds for extra flinch, or Armor-Piercing Rounds you're likely to be in a crowd in CQC, so APR can be useful to damage more than one enemy at a time, or Ricochet Rounds or Flared Magwell will add additional stability to help control the recoil. As you're likely to be in CQC, Threat Detector should be proccing to provide extra gunfeel stats. In the second trait column, Swashbuckler or Kill Clip are reliable sources of extra damage to keep kill streaks going.

// Disparity PvE first-choice roll
// Fluted Barrel, Arrowhead Brake, Flared Magwell, Tactical Mag, Rapid Hit, Outlaw, Frenzy, One For All, Swashbuckler, Desperado
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. Shapeable. First-choice PvE roll for endgame content. The Ambush origin trait is probably more for PvP than PvE, with the extra range, handling and 10% boost to damage for a few moments after combat starts, or use Hakke Breach Armaments if you're going to face vehicles, turrets or constructs. This is the only currentas at v6.3.0.2 me aggressive frame pulse rifle in the kinetic slot, so it's worth hanging on a good roll.  Correct the wonky recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake, or Fluted Barrel makes it feel snappier and more stable. In the mag, Flared Magwell or Tactical Mag are the best options, adding more stability and reload speed. Rapid Hit and Outlaw both proc on the on crits, and then match this with your choice of the range of damage output-increasing traits. Recommended MW: Handling or Reload Speed, with a damage-boosting Minor, Major or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

// IKELOS_HC_v1.0.3 PvE backup roll
// Fluted Barrel, Corkscrew Rifling, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Seraph Rounds, Stats for All, Rapid Hit, Triple Tap, One for All, Frenzy, Focused Fury
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. Backup PvE roll for end-game add clear. Shapeable. The Rasputin's Arsenal origin trait reloads on a shield break, which should save on a few reloads. Precisions aren't the strongest choice for PvE as at Season 19 v6.3.0.2, and the Ikelos HC's stats are pretty bad across the board, but there are a few combinations that are still interesting. Fill in some of the stat gaps in Handling and Range with your barrel, and then with the combined goodness of Armor-Piercing, High-Caliber and Ricochet Rounds, Seraph Rounds is a clear first choice in the mag. For end-game add clear, use a little of column one to fill out the stat gaps, and then a bit of column two to boost your damage and with OFA and Frenzy, help your stats even more. Recommended  MW: Range or Handling, with a damage-boosting Minor, Major or Taken Spec or Backup Mag mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

// Stay Frosty PvE backup roll
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. PvE backup roll for end-game match game activities and anti-Barrier Champions when the mod's around. Option of Omolon Fluid Dynamics or the Dawning Surprise origin trait can help you gain ability energy and restart healing by collecting a small box after killing a half-dozen enemies or so. This is the first Stasis Lightweight frame Pulse Rifle, the frame providing +20 mobility and 6.25% boost to movement, and the first to roll with Adaptive Munitions to provide a shield-busting primary in the kinetic slot. Has decent stats compared to kinetic Lightweights. Sort out the wonky recoil direction with Arrowhead Brake, and any of the Combat Effect Mag perks or Flared Magwell add utility. In the absence of a complementary column 1 trait, Thresh provides a nice little boost to super regeneration. But the real gold is Adaptive Munitions in trait column 2 for primary ammo shield busting in the kinetic slot for the first time. Recommended MW: Stability or Range, with a damage-boosting Minor, Major or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-minor, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

// Mechabre PvE backup roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Corkscrew Rifling, Extended Mag, Clown Cartridge, Triple Tap, Vorpal Weapon, High-Impact Reserves
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 37. PvE backup roll for sustained damage against Bosses. The Origin Trait, gaining better ADS and strafe speed when on your own, might be useful when you're away from your fireteam, but think of it more as a useful added extra when it's procced. Direct competitor to Occluded Finality, but with a much more reasonable 45 Zoom. You don't really need to worry about range, so look to boost Handling with the barrel. You want to go all in to the magazine size, so use Extended Barrel and Backup Mag to get to five in the mag. In the first trait column, Clown Cartridge boosts magazine size by up to three on reload, and in the second column, Vorpal Weapon adds 15% damage against Majors, Bosses and vehicles or High-Impact Reserves will add up to 25% bonus damage once you get past the second bullet. Recommended MW: Reload Speed, with a damage-boosting Boss or Taken Spec mod. Tags: PvE, PvE-Boss, PvE-BossSpec, PvE-EndGame, Controller, MKB tags:pve, pve-boss, pve-endgame, controller, mkb

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 34. PvE backup roll for minor add control in end-game content. Probably only necessary if you've not already got a Blinding Grenade roll on an Ignition Code or Pardon Our Dust.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 32. PvE backup roll for endgame content. Sidearms aren't first choice for end-game activities but, if you're forced to use one there because of an anti-Champion mod, the you do have some options here. Range is highly constrained maximising it only gets you another 0.7m when ADS, so you'll get more value out of Handling or Stability from your barrel, and any of the combat effect mods Armor-Piercing, High Caliber or Riochet Rounds will work. Threat Detector Works with a CQC weapon like a sidearm for gunfeel boosts, including reloads, helping uptime with  Swashbucker's 33% damage boost after a melee kill.

// The Last Breath PvE backup roll
// Polygonal Riling, Smallbore, Corkscrew Rifling, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Armor-Piercing Rounds, High-Caliber Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Demolitionist, Osmosis
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 25. PvE backup roll for end-game content. Adaptive auto-rifles are still pretty competitive as at S17 v4.1.5.2. In the same slot as Duty Bound or Scathelocke, which both have better Zoom, so you might need a touch of either range or stability, depending on preference, to compensate with the barrel, and one of the Combat Effect magazines adds a little range and a utility effect. For end-game, particularly solo, content, it's difficult to top Demolitionist and Osmosis to give you an additional element to help break shields.

// The Last Breath PvE backup roll
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 25. PvE backup roll for end-game content. Adaptive auto-rifles are still pretty competitive as at S17 v4.1.5.2. In the same slot as Duty Bound or Scathelocke, which both have better Zoom, so you might need a touch of either range or stability, depending on preference, to compensate. Arrowhead Brake helps tidy up the wonky recoil and one of the Combat Effect magazines adds a little range and some utility effect. For end-game content, Demolitionist and Adrenaline Junkie is a natural pairing, for grenade-based builds. Drops from the second Hexahedron Room encounter if you're looking to farm it. Recommended MW: Stability, Range or Reload Speed, with a damage boosting Minor, Major or Taken Spec mod. tags:pve, pve-endgame, pve-minor, controller, mkb

// Judgment PvE backup roll
// SteadyHand HCS, TrueSight HCS, Hitmark HCS, Tactical Mag, Appended Mag, Demolitionist, Osmosis
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 25. PvE backup roll for end-game content. Very stiff competition in-slot from Fatebringer, Eyasluna and DFA, but there are a few trait combinations that help claim a spot in your Vault. Look to boost Handling and Stability with sight and mag, to help gunfeel or maybe add a bullet or two. For end-game, particularly solo, content, it's difficult to top Demolitionist and Osmosis to give you an additional element to help break shields. Drops from the first Phalanx Echo encounter if you're looking to farm it.

//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 23. PvE backup roll for endgame content and anti-Champion mods. Still worth looking at, even without an origin perk, for void burn activities. The Recoil Direction needs some love, or stability to keep the shots on target as much as possible from barrel and mag. For endgame and anti-Champion use particularly Overloads, Fourth Time's the Charm and Explosive Payload are your top choices for the two trait slots on mouse and keyboard.

// Fang of Ir Yût PvE first-choice roll
// Arrowhead Brake, Fluted Barrel, High-Caliber Rounds, Armor-Piercing Rounds, Ricochet Rounds, Rewind Rounds, Precision Instrument
//notes:Inspired by @PodvsEnemies Podcast vs Enemies episode 79 https://open.spotify.com/episode/1qz5FD88RfmGHDjedV6nGo?si=7e1c1558ecea4f1c with @ImpetusAlways, @Saint_Kabr and @CourtProjects. First-choice PvE pick for add clearing chunkier Minor Spec enemies in end-gamecontent. Shapeable. This is the first rapid-fire Strand scout rifle so you get an Alloy Mag-like 20% quicker reload animation when the magazine is empty, with best-in-class stats compared to other RFs in the kinetic slot. The recoil direction is a bit shonky, so Arrowhead Brake cleans that up a bit, but if you feel able to control it, Fluted Barrel adds to handling for general snappiness. You can choose from any of the combat effect rounds as the mag perk, depending on your preference. Rewind Rounds in the first trait column as the support perk works well with new-to-season-22 Precision Instrument in the second as the signature perk to keep the higher damage stacks going for longer, before you reload. The Cursed Thrall origin perk synergises well with melee builds and is a lot of fun for helping soften up groups of enemies when active.

First-choice PvE pick for Arc synergy add-clear against Minor Spec enemies in general content. Barrel and Mag re-shapeable. Oversoul Edict offers the usual rapid-fire intrinsic 20% faster reload animation when the mag is empty and middling stats by comarison with energy slot peers. Controlling the recoil direction means Arrowhead Brake is the best barrel perk, taking it to an almost not terrible 79. Take your choice of rounding out some of the gunfeel stats with Flared Magwell, or any of the combat effect magazine perks. In the first trait column as the support perk, Enlightened Action will take the base handling to 82 and reload speed to 84 within two bursts, if every shot hits. This will mean a fast reload to proc Voltshot after a kill to apply Jolt on enemies and tie in with your arc verbs. The Cursed Thrall origin perk synergises well with melee builds and is a lot of fun for helping soften up groups of enemies when active.

// IKELOS_SMG_v1.0.3 PvE backup roll
// Full Bore, Hammer-Forged Rifling, Tactical Mag, Flared Magwell, Threat Detector, Perpetual Motion, Surrounded
//notes:Inspired by DMB PvE Podcast 44. Backup PvE roll for end-game add clear. Shapeable. It's already an S-Tier stat monster and the Rasputin's Arsenal origin trait reloads on a shield break, which should save on a few reloads. Not having to worry about stability as much, you might as well push out the range as far as you can for M&KB, and if you're in CQC you want your reload to be as fast as possible - Tactical Mag and Flared Magwell both help out. If you're looking at end-game add-clearing, Threat Detector will speed up your reloads and boost your stability while you're in CQC or Perpetual Motion will do the same just for moving about a bit and Surrounded boosts damage by 36.5% and the enhanced version by 47%. But, even though this is a great roll, you'll still know in your heart that you really wanted Voltshot...

//notes:Inspired by DMB Podcast 263 conversation with @illPhysics. PvP first-choice S-Tier roll for duelling. Arguably the one of the best PvP hand-cannons as at S17, if you're not mainly in the air, anyway - almost feels like you have an additional perk boost in the base stats, and has the highest base stability of any legendary HC. Boost Handling and Stability with our sight and mag. Snapshot Sights still at S17 gets you into ADS in an engagement faster, and Rangefinder improves both your damage and aim assist dropoffs.
